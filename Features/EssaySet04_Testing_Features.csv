Although the flower of hibiscus is not as appealing, it undergoes the cruel weather. Also, Saeng  thinks,” Back home it just grew wild, jutting tiled roofs.” The hibiscus not only reminds her that she will overcome obstacles as long as she perseveres but also arouses her memories back home. It is inevitable that  new immigrants feel lonesome and get homesick. The hibiscus, commonly found in Vietnam, comforts Saeng.
