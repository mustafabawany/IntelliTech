5,16639,6,"In the piece ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in their attempt in allowing dirigibles to dock there.

These were obstacles that made it so that the Empire State Building could ""never fulfill its purpose"".        The first obstacle is the framework of the building, which the piece said would be put under stress by the massive weight of the dirigibles. This was an obstacle for the builders because they wanted to ensure the safety of the people in the building and they did not want the building to collapse. As @CAPS1 points out, this resulted in ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The second obstacle was the type of gas used to make them float, which was highly flammable.

This was an obstacle because ""if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" there would be serious damages to the city, as well as many other casualties.

61,16695,6,"When designing the Empire State Building the builders faced problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First off, there were many safety issues.

Another issue that would cause a safety issue was the changing wind. These dirigibles ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street.""

176,16810,6,"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the competition with the @CAPS1 building, stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure, and the dirigible gases and the airship law. To begin with, the @CAPS1 building was going to be 46 ft higher than the Empire State building, so builders had an obstacle in their hand and came up with building a top that would make the Empire State building 1,250 feet, taller than the @CAPS1. Also, the idea with the dirigible tieing up to the building's top would add more stress to the building and the wind pressure, would be transferred to the buildings foundation. Builders had to modify and strengthen the building, which cost @MONEY1. Another reason, was that dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable. There had been an accident in @LOCATION2 when their dirigible caught on fire.

One of these problems was something they could not control. Wind speeds and currents. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1). The mast could not accommodate the weather which was its greatest obstacle because the winds are so unpredictable. Another thing the dirigibles dock had working against it was a federal law.

320,16954,6,"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, dirigibles would put a great amount of strain on the building while they were docked, due to their large size and high winds at that height. As result, the builders of the Empire State building were forced to make ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to the building's frame. Also, many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable and would pose a major threat to the safety of numerous civilians. After the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" went up in flames, concerns about the safety of hydrogen dirigibles rose sharply throughout the world.

362,16996,6,"In The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION1; the workers on the dirigible mast had many problems that would hinder the attempt for dirigibles to dock there. The first reason was the gas used to make the dirigibles float. The gas, helium, was very flamable. After the Hindenburg went down in flames they realized ""... how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a den sely populated area such as downtown New York."" The second obstacle was the violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around...""

499,17133,6,The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example is stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1 the architects had to consult with the experts and take tours of the equipment that the mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION1 contained. They also had to meet with the President of an airship transport company. The architects couldn't just design this mast and drop it on the empire state building. As said in @CAPS1 @NUM2 the buildings frame wasnt the right condition so they would have to rebuild the building's frame for over sixty thousand dollars.

527,17161,6,"The builders of the Empire State Building had faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. The first problem they encountered was the construction of the building. The foundation of the Empire State Building had to be able to withstand the weight of the dirigibles and constant changes in wind pressure. They completed the framing work and passed that obstacle, when another took it's place.

534,17168,6,"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example of there challenges was that ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building… it would add stress to the buildings frame… the frame would have to be modified for the situation."" @CAPS2 they basically would have to re-build the buildings frame which is time consuming and expensive.

582,17216,6,"There were many obstacles the builders had to face. First, they needed to cover the stress of a moored dirigible on top of the building. The dirigible is quite a heavy load and great wind pressure. So, the strength of the building would need to be strengthened in order to support the dirigible. It was such a problem that they spent over sixty thouasnd dollars to adapt the building to the dirigible's stress. Also many dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas and as seen with the horrible Hindenburg event, it could happen.

Ironicly; Dirigibles (known today as blimps) were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The main obstacle for the dirigibles was the lack of a Suitable landing area.
