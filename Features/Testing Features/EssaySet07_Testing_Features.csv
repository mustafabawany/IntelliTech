3550,19571,7,"Being patient is hard for lots of people. The feeling of knowing something is coming up and you have to wait for it. Every year at @CAPS1 I can’t wait to open my presents.

But I be patient and wait until @CAPS1 morning. When @CAPS1 morning comes I take a sigh of relief knowing that I’ve been patient all these days and I finally get to open them. Being patient is harder then it seems. Even if you just have to wait five minutes in a traffic jam or even waiting in the lunch line it can get really boring. Then we think everybody has to be patient sometimes so we should just stop and smell the roses and be patient. It will end sooner or later. Being patient can have lots of rewards. Lets say you’ve been trying really hard to be maneger. you find out you didn’t win. So you be patient and keep trying. There will be other opportunities. You just have to be patient.

3660,19707,7,"At the start of the school year, my @NUM1 grade year my mom made me a promise. A promise saying that if I got all A’s all year she would buy me an ipod @CAPS1. I tried my best to earn all A’s. The school year went on day by day, week by week, quarter by quarter. And just when my grades started to slip I brought it back up. I found out in @DATE3 a couple weeks before school ended that I was going to get straight A’s. I told my mom and she said, “@CAPS2 like you’re getting that ipod.” When she said that I was happy knowing that I would finally get an ipod. My brother had one, and he was always bragging about how cool it was. It was @DATE1 when the school finally ended. That day I asked my mom when I was going to get my ipod and she said soon. So I waited a week and I still didn’t get it. I then started to get upset. But right then I realized that the more I begged and the more I was upset the longer it would take for me to get it. Recently, this @DATE2 I figure out that being patient and waiting to get my ipod was a very smart choice. They came out with a new ipod, with two cameras, one on the front, and one on the back. I was feeling good about the choice I made, and that’s when my mom decided to buy me the ipod. That day I learnt a very important lesson. Patient is a good thing, even if it does seem hard at times. You see, sometimes in life it seems as if when you see something you want, you tend to just go after it, and get it as soon as possible.

She didn't like the water though. I think it is cause we got her in the @DATE1 and she didn't get to be in the water when she was really young / little. After I had her a while she got to come out of her kennel at night, she was in a kennel because she wasn't pody trained yet so I had to be patient and wait for her to stop going to the bathroom on the floor after that everything went pretty well she was pody trained and mine. Then when she turned about @NUM2 ½ she started to chew on our shoes so then I had to break that habit of that so that took me about a month to do.

3966,20115,7,"A person I know that has a incredible amount of patience would have to be @PERSON1. He's the only science teacher for @NUM1 and @NUM2 graders. He is a really good guy once you get to know him more. The reason I think @PERSON1 has patience is because us as students are really loud and energetic all the time. I should know when our class is overly energetic, it's really noticeable. This is @PERSON1's first year teaching at @LOCATION1 crest charter @CAPS1. We are highly annoying at times and sometimes I get spaz attacks from my classes. Usually teachers will say ''@CAPS2 down!'' or ''shush!'' or something like that. @PERSON1 isn't one of those @CAPS3, he'll just stand still and cross his arms while looking at us. He never told us what that meant, but as times passed on we found out by ourselves, I don't think I have ever heard him shout at us or be really mad about it. In fact @PERSON1 hasn't even complained about it. Not even once have I heard him! Today during the meap, @PERSON3 said we could get a snack from our lockers quietly. @CAPS4 we did get our snacks from our lockers. But not quietly like he said or told us. @CAPS4 he just gave us the posture he makes when were loud, then we sat quietly for our next part of the meap. I'm really happy @PERSON1 is our home room teacher because he has a good sence of humor and he is also very understanding every single day. I think all teachers (including @PERSON1) have a huge amount of patience if I should say @CAPS4 my self. Right now, every body is either working hard and quietly on their meap or they are reading a book silently to themselfs. I can't hear @CAPS3 talking to each other @CAPS4 that means the class is silent. I don't know how this class would end up without @PERSON2 I know for a fact that @PERSON1 is awesome because he has good sence of humor, smart, and he knows how to keep us on the ball. @CAPS4 I know that @PERSON1 is one of the most patient person I know @CAPS4 far. He's always in a good mode and I've never seen him have a bad side. @CAPS4 he's a  awesome guy!
