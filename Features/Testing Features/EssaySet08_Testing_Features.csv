0,21634,8," I had never met a person in my life, who could make anyone smile, turn their head, or know that that familiar voice coming from the stranger across the room, was a great person. I met this woman many years ago, camping at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 weekend, @DATE1. We had parked next to each other unknowingly, until her laughter poured out of her motor home's doors. This was the moment I knew @PERSON1, along with her family, would become great friends of mine. That weekend we had many family dinners together, including @CAPS1 dinner, went riding in good weather, along with bad, and shared memories neither one of our familys could ever forget. @PERSON1 was a great woman who had three beautiful children and a life she controlled every minute of, she always had a smile on her face, and a dog on her lap.  She has a free spirit and open mind to everyone and every moment she lived, I believe would be obvious to any stranger walking down the street. For the last several months I had the opportunity of living with @PERSON1 and her family, and we spent all day and @TIME1 with each other, playing rummy, swimming at all hours of the @TIME1, going to reggae concerts, trying to sing along to music we didn't really know, and just laughing at the smallest things. @PERSON1 was the kind of woman who takes in kids and animals off the streets, bathes, keeps warm and most of all loves them. She adopted her son's best friend, @PERSON2, after his mother kicked him out, and he has now been with her family for the last five years, I sure don't know anyone now a days who would do that, but @PERSON1 did. Anyone could walk into her home, uninvited and be welcomed like her own family, @PERSON1 would do anything and everything for people who might not do the same for her, but she knew that someday her kind heart would pay off.   @PERSON1 raised four amazing kids, and they all resemble her in every way. Each of them always keep an open mind to new things, new places and new people. Much like their mother, they would all give more than they would ever expect to receive back. It wasn't the sound or the idea of her laughter that drew people into her, its was a familiar voice to all, even to the unknown man. Her laughter could fill a room, and if you were close to her, you know who and where she was. Her laughter always gave others, along with myself, that no matter what race you were, orientation you lived by, years you had lived - basically whatever made you different to the person sitting next to you, @PERSON1 wouldn't put you out or leave you behind. Her mind, body, and soul was like swinging doors, opening both ways, she could always help you get to where you would like to go. During the speeches at her funeral, people always said she always did everything she could, she would help you in anyways possible, even if that required a loss for herself. Family friends commented that she just loved, lived and enjoyed every minute of it. Every person had something to say, and every word spoken about @PERSON1 was positive, filled with love, laughter, friendship, an idealistic life many would have liked to live. @PERSON1 chose her life, made each day worth it, spent every minute doing something she enjoyed. She was a great influence on my life, and now that she has passed, I would like to learn to live my life the way she did. With no worries at hand, a smile from ear to ear, and welcoming arms, @PERSON1 brought meaning to living a happy life.   I like to believe whatever took her to heaven gets to see her rainbow aurora, her silly contagious smile, and cherishes it. Because every person down here, misses her dearly, and each day, we hear her laughter, the sound of her motherly, yet best friend voice easily speaking to us. I miss her dearly, but the last several months, are dearly cherished, and will always be remembered. She taught me there is no second chances, if your late, your late. @PERSON1, had a heart of gold, and a laugh that spread love and life quicker than light travels.

Laughter can bring families together, it can bring adversaries together, but most importantly, it can bring strangers together and start a wonderful or terrible relationship. Whether this relationship is terrible or wonderful completely depends on the individuals involved, but what matters most in a relationship of this form, is that it was created out of something as simple as laughter. I, myself, have had an unique experience with laughter that made a profound impact on my life. Laughter made me feel like I was giving something to the world instead of taking something from it. Laughter made me feel like I had done something good for a change. I used laughter in a time where there should be none to overcome my problems and help others do the same for themselves. This laughter brought strangers together and gave them the power to bring others joy and happiness through laughter. You can change a life with laughter. Laughter is an incredible thing. Not so long ago, (in @DATE1 to be precise), I got in trouble with the law. Before I get into too much detail on reasons of my legal issues, I would like to provide some background information to give an insight to how my brain works and how I think. Therefor, you can better understand my life and the decisions I had made to put myself is this predicament. I am the child of @PERSON2, a compassionate but judgmental woman from an upper-class family in the suburbs of @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and @PERSON1, a persistent but controlling woman from a extremely low-class family in @LOCATION3. Please do not get my confused, I love both of my parents dearly and I am proud to be their son, and only because of this love I can openly admit their flaws. We all have flaws. There is no perfection is this or any universe. The reason this is important is because a child is raised with an essence of the parents within them. As their spawn I contain an essence from both of them. Part of them is part of me. A more unusual part of my childhood as I'm sure you have already discovered is: I am a son born to lesbian parents. Therefor, I have had an unusual childhood full of reality and life meaning questioning. I was taught to deal with this with Laughter. I learned to laugh at the irony of my life. And it is ironic that this same method of using laughter helped me overcome a majority of the problems I've encountered in this life of mine, including the one I am about to relay. In the @DATE1, I did get in quite a bit of trouble with the law. I was sent to a juvenile detention center in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION1. I was required to spend six months in this place and go to mandatory group sessions. Here is where I met others like myself. Others that have had trouble with their reality in their life. Others that have been placed in this confinement for testing their reality. This group of mine met three times a week in the courtyard, maybe even four if the weather was permitting. We did not talk about the feeling remorse for our actions or feeling like we had done something wrong. Instead we focused on how we could deal with our reality questioning in a way that did not cause chaos, for others or for ourselves. We focused on rehabilitation. This was a good thing. We were not being told there was something wrong with us, but instead there were things that we could do to help us function in this life easier. At the beginning, I'm sure that non of the individuals that we assigned to these meetings took them seriously. The thought of going to a rehab session triggered guilt and anger. But as time passed I began to see that this really was for my benefit. I spread this new-found knowledge to my peers, and they soon made the same discovery I'd made.  In one of these group sessions, the leader told us that we should try and make something. Something as a group because to show that we were all similar and could connect to help eachother. While brainstorming on things we could make, I remembered using laughter to deal with the questions I encountered. I then got the idea of sharing this laughter with others by form of comedy. I shared this idea with the group and it sparked. We were making skits in the next five minutes. The next week, we had come up with a half-hour routine. It was so good we were chosen to run this in front of the whole detention center. I remember looking to the right of me while we preformed and seeing the smiling faces of not only the audience, but my fellow inmates. They both laughed together. We all laughed.

I, myself, have had an unique experience with laughter that made a profound impact on my life. Laughter made me feel like I was giving something to the world instead of taking something from it. Laughter made me feel like I had done something good for a change. I used laughter in a time where there should be none to overcome my problems and help others do the same for themselves. This laughter brought strangers together and gave them the power to bring others joy and happiness through laughter. You can change a life with laughter. Laughter is an incredible thing. Not so long ago, (in @DATE1 to be precise), I got in trouble with the law. Before I get into too much detail on reasons of my legal issues, I would like to provide some background information to give an insight to how my brain works and how I think. Therefor, you can better understand my life and the decisions I had made to put myself is this predicament. I am the child of @PERSON2, a compassionate but judgmental woman from an upper-class family in the suburbs of @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and @PERSON1, a persistent but controlling woman from a extremely low-class family in @LOCATION3. Please do not get my confused, I love both of my parents dearly and I am proud to be their son, and only because of this love I can openly admit their flaws. We all have flaws. There is no perfection is this or any universe. The reason this is important is because a child is raised with an essence of the parents within them. As their spawn I contain an essence from both of them. Part of them is part of me. A more unusual part of my childhood as I'm sure you have already discovered is: I am a son born to lesbian parents. Therefor, I have had an unusual childhood full of reality and life meaning questioning. I was taught to deal with this with Laughter. I learned to laugh at the irony of my life. And it is ironic that this same method of using laughter helped me overcome a majority of the problems I've encountered in this life of mine, including the one I am about to relay. In the @DATE1, I did get in quite a bit of trouble with the law. I was sent to a juvenile detention center in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION1. I was required to spend six months in this place and go to mandatory group sessions. Here is where I met others like myself. Others that have had trouble with their reality in their life. Others that have been placed in this confinement for testing their reality. This group of mine met three times a week in the courtyard, maybe even four if the weather was permitting. We did not talk about the feeling remorse for our actions or feeling like we had done something wrong. Instead we focused on how we could deal with our reality questioning in a way that did not cause chaos, for others or for ourselves. We focused on rehabilitation. This was a good thing. We were not being told there was something wrong with us, but instead there were things that we could do to help us function in this life easier. At the beginning, I'm sure that non of the individuals that we assigned to these meetings took them seriously. The thought of going to a rehab session triggered guilt and anger. But as time passed I began to see that this really was for my benefit. I spread this new-found knowledge to my peers, and they soon made the same discovery I'd made. In one of these group sessions, the leader told us that we should try and make something. Something as a group because to show that we were all similar and could connect to help eachother. While brainstorming on things we could make, I remembered using laughter to deal with the questions I encountered. I then got the idea of sharing this laughter with others by form of comedy. I shared this idea with the group and it sparked. We were making skits in the next five minutes. The next week, we had come up with a half-hour routine. It was so good we were chosen to run this in front of the whole detention center. I remember looking to the right of me while we preformed and seeing the smiling faces of not only the audience, but my fellow inmates. They both laughed together. We all laughed.

I knew that everybody in my grade was going to change schools the @DATE1 and we were going to be separated each other. It was hard to think about. Our grade was small: only eleven people and we were all close friends. We had grown up together for so many years and seen each other every day; it seemed so hard for us all to have the same kind of friendship when we were all apart. We spent our last weeks of school all together as a big group. We ate our lunches together and spent time together on our last eighth grade retreat. We all knew that after the @DATE1 was over we would not see each other every day like we were used to. So we built memories to make up for that future time when we would not bee together. We knew they were good ones when we would all laugh together. It was something that connected us in a shared experience--a shared emotion. Even though our time together was going to end, we knew that any memories we had would not. By freshman @DATE1 we were all continuing our lives apart. I was assimilated into my new school: I had met many new people, and had a lot of work in all of my new classes. I barely ever saw my friends from my old school during the @DATE1. Maybe only five or six times. I had my memories with them, but I could not spend time with them face to face. It was strange to go from seeing them every day to barely seeing them at all. One would think that things would be different between us all. Yet, somehow when we were together, it felt like nothing had changed. I realized that when I got together with my best friend from middle school one @DATE2 for a sleepover. The first fifteen minutes when we were together it was awkward. We hadn't seen each other in a while and were not sure what we needed to catch up on first. We ended up making small talk, something we almost never have had to do in the past. But after we talked for a while we started to get comfortable again and talk like we used to. She showed me her new high school yearbook and pointed out her friends so I had a better idea of who she was talked about when she told her stories. I described all of my new friends for her as well. We shared new stories and we remembered old ones. The best part was that we started to laugh. Not short giggles every once and a while, but full out laughter. She had her distinctive laugh, almost a guffaw. She would tilt her head back or lean backwards as she laughed. When she was done with a particular burst of laughter she would breath out in a sigh before starting up again. I had my distinctive laugh too. It wasn't a disticntive sound that made up my laugh, it was the action of falling over that made it mine. I would end up on the floor laughing almost to the point where I couldn't breath. But the near choking was still a good feeling. Even though all our stories and the people in them had changed, we still laughed together the way we used to. I was still able to recognize her laugh and she was able to recognize mine. They sounded and looked the same as they did in eighth grade when we were on our retreat.

3,21638,8," As humans, we have the unparalleled ability to experience a vast range of emotions. Of course nobody relishes the feeling of embarrassment or that of a broken heart, but to compensate for these morose feelings we also have feelings of exuberance, rejoicing, and perhaps the greatest expression for them of all, laughter. It has been demonstrated to us by our own personal experiences that laughter is an immense aid in increasing the vivacity of our lives. Laughter is quite easily the safest, and most natural drug to feeling good, and it comes at a fantastic price; for free. Perhaps that is why I myself value comedic nature and optimistic thinking in contrast to my realistic perspective on things. Without it, how else would people be able to claw out of the sand traps of misery this world consumes us in? Whether we look for laughter or not, it always has a way of finding us, and on a sun soaked day @DATE1 it chose to find me. The streets carried a light cool in their breeze as it was not yet noon in @DATE4 and the cool morning air still slithered through the streets of @LOCATION1, fleeing the torturing sting of the @DATE1 sun. My sister and I were browsing the colorful stalls of the @DATE2 @CAPS1 while the sound of musicians played near some fountains and the smell of churros and elephant ears blanketed the area. Normally a day like this would have me incapable of untwisting the smile on my face, but @DATE6 was not like usual. An almost tangible wall of impatience and provocation stood between my sister and I belonging to the extremity of a relationship that is not easily conceivable to those without a sibling. Some days everything is just peaches and you are each others best friend. On other days the only desirable way of conversing is via short sentences barked through hormonal filled clouds of fury.  Needless to say it was a cloudy morning that day. Words spoken to one another came out as snide comments or rude remarks and it took every drop of composure we had to not initiate a full fledged battle between the other. The idea of spending the entirety of our day with the objects of our enmity was not in the least bit engaging, however,my grandmother's birthday was approaching next @DATE3 and even though it seemed like a mild form of torture, my sister and I made the decision to follow through with our plan to search for a suitable gift. If there was one person who had mediated any fight we had or solved the hardest of problems, it was my grandmother @CAPS2. And with that we stepped off of the max train into @LOCATION1. Agreeing on an item to buy does not come easily when the partner in your purchase won't speak to you. My sister and I milled about for an hour or so with no discoveries. Better yet, we ceased to find anything that would spark conversation enough to break the silent treatment policy we had instated. The sun skated to its midpoint in the sky and we both realized it was nearing lunch time. Making eye contact for the first time since our arrival, my sister nodded to the ice cream stand a few feet to my right. Shuffling to it we bought ourselves each a double scoop. Cookie @CAPS3 for me and @CAPS4 for her, disgusting. Keeping with the theme of the day we sat separately on a wall of stone steps near the fountain area to eat. But before I could even taste the cookie @CAPS3 flavor fill my mouth, I felt a very different sensation all together. The sensation of a cold, slightly sticky mass sliding down my chest and onto my stomach. Dumbfounded at how my ice cream had misplaced my torso for my mouth I said nothing, but glanced up to see my sister staring. We sustained eye contact for a few long seconds and I gradually felt my mouth mirror the smile that slowly blossomed on my sister's face. Suddenly something chimed in the air that nullified the wall that stood earlier. The noise was laughter and it babbled from us like a @DATE5 brook. After making our amends to each other for our hostile behavior before, our laughter continued long after we had cleaned me up as best as we could and shared my sister's repulsive @CAPS4 ice cream.  The medicine of laughter truly is the antidote to misery. It holds a universal key to unlock the grips of any obstacle one might face, regardless the expanses to which it pertains. On that day in @DATE4 a seemingly ill-fated day quickly metamorphosized into a resplendent memory, one I will never forget.

When with friends and family most likely some of your best memory are made when there is something going on that made you laugh. Laughing not only puts yourself in a good mood but also every one around you. When you can make everyone laugh and put people in a good mood, in most cases you will be viewed as a fun, self confident person.

We where all busy the first few hours setting up camp. Once camp was set up we made a fire and sat around it. The evening was awkward and silent for a short time because none of us other than @PERSON4 knew each other. Things started to get better when @PERSON4 started telling everyone about the prank war me and him had been having over the past few months. @CAPS2 started  "" this whole thing started when @PERSON1 put plastic wrap outside of my door so I ran in to it when i woke up in the morning."" I interrupted. "" no actually this started because @PERSON4 called me short and made fun of me, I cant help that im not tall.""  @CAPS2 continued his story about all the pranks we had pulled on each other like how i put butter all over his kitchen floor, then called his house phone so when @CAPS2 ran in there to answer it @CAPS2 slipped. @CAPS2 told of how @CAPS2 put his snake in my bed and scared me and how @CAPS2 filled my bathtub with green jello. After some good laughs we all warmed up and started talking and telling our own stories. Later that day we all went down to the river. @PERSON4 saw a small lime green frog and picked it up. @CAPS2 held it up to my face and said  "" kiss it @PERSON1 maybe it will turn in to a prince! "", I said "" no way dude im not going to kiss a frog"" @CAPS2 replied with "" and this is why you will never find true love @PERSON1 i mean you got to take a chance now and then you know.""I told him that I had a prince and @CAPS2 was much more handsome then the frog could ever become.  After a good time at the river we went back up to camp and ate dinner and talked some more around the fire. That night @PERSON4 broke the zipper on his tent so lucky me I had to share my tent with him. After everyone went to bed we went out of the tent and where getting something to eat when @PERSON4 said ""whoa did you see that!"" as @CAPS2 quickly looked up at the sky. Naturally I looked up and said ""what is it."" @CAPS2 just laughed at me because there was nothing there @CAPS2 just wanted me to look.

I noticed that there was a bunch of small fish in the water and i pointed them out to @PERSON4.

So then later that day we went to go watch a movie the theater and we saw ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"", my friends thought it was funny and, the next day we were laughing about the movie still, because it was still funny so we rented that movie so our parents can watch it they were non stop on talking bout it too. So, now we are having all of family and friends little small get together, cause since they like to laugh it would be best for them and us five to watch a movie that has a lot of comedy for us.

11,21649,8," Moving is never an easy thing to do. You have already established some very goods friends, and now you have to leave them. Recently, that is just what I have done. My most recent move from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 has been an extremely difficult thing for me to do because I had created such strong ties with my friends back in @LOCATION1. But through good times and bad, my friends in @LOCATION1 have always been there to give me a good laugh or two when I need it the most. When I seem to be down or low, they always seem to know how to fix it, even when I am nearly six-hundred miles away. Before I left, my girlfriends decided to throw me a surprise ""going-away"" party. They went all out; balloons, a cake, games, and movies. The absolutely best thing, though, was that we all watched the movie The @ORGANIZATION1. It's one of those teenage girl movies that is so stupid , yet it makes you laugh so hard that you cry! My friends and I would constantly quote the movie back and forth to each other in school, through texts, or whenever else we could. I thought that @ORGANIZATION1 was the funniest thing, and my friends knew that, so when they brought it to the party, I was ecstatic! We watched it, I think, three times in a row. We laughed, and laughed, and then laughed some more. I think we actually laughed so hard that it had looked like we had been crying for a few hours! Each time a scene came on that we knew the lines to, we would quote them back and forth to each other; it was absolutely hysterical! Needless to say, all of us were brain dead the next morning. The next day came, and the party was over. We all had finally begun to realize that it was the last day I would get to hang out with my friends again (or at least until I go back in the @DATE1). There were tears shed and hugs all around, but we couldn't get past the fact that we might not see each other again. Yes, there is @CAPS1 that we could chat on; we can call or text each other; but it is just not the same as being able to have your friends right there beside you. The following @DATE2 at school, as I was turning in the last of my books, I gave my final hugs goodbye. I couldn't help but cry, knowing that they would miss me just as much, or maybe even more, as I would miss them. I made my way towards the school's front doors, when I heard one of my friends yell my name. I turned around to look at her, and she yelled at me in her deepest ""man voice"" possible, ""@CAPS2 me, do you know where the crapper is? I need to do something mysterious in there,"" now in a whisper, but still in a a manly voice, ""drop off some timber!"" I couldn't help but burst into a fit of laughter. That was our favorite quote from @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1! My girlfriends and I used to run up and down the halls of the school practically yodeling that quote back and forth to each other.We all exploded into giggles and laughs, with tears coming down like @ORGANIZATION2. They even followed me out to my car as I walked out, still quoting more of @ORGANIZATION1 movie. After that, I knew that everything would be okay. Living in @LOCATION2, about six-hundred miles from my hometown in @LOCATION1, hasn't stopped me from keeping in touch with my friends. We call each other; we send letters, and we even chat on @CAPS1. We are always updating each other with news of new boyfriends, school, and just life in general.

13,21651,8," During the @DATE1, I decided to take a step outside of my comfort-zone and do something extraordinary. I didn't know how this decision was going to change my life. One hot @DATE1 day in @LOCATION1, a bus was making its way to @LOCATION2.The bus was full of excited and worry-free people. When the bus crossed the border, however, the expression on people's face changed dramatically. A border, a mere line on the map, represents so much more. One side of the border was remarkably better than the other. It was as if the two sides were two different worlds. On one, people live in the most comfortable settings, whereas in the other, it seemed like they don't have what they need to keep themselves alive. As the bus took us through this 'new' world, the expression of shock was shared by everyone. As we approached closer to the camp site, we were able to get a better glimpse of the houses, or so they were called. The buildings had cracks all over the walls which made it seem like they would collapse in any minute. This was not, could not be someone's home.  On the first day of work, we were introduced to a family for whom we were to build a house. This family was consisted of a young mom and her kids. There were @NUM1 kids, and the older one was in middle school. The father was nowhere to be found. As we got to work, the family observed. The expression on their faces was very difficult to read. However, for every smile we gave, they returned. During the little breaks, I was able to get to know the older one, the boy, better. As a student who took @CAPS1 in high school, the means of communication was limited. The thing that connected us was an old soccer ball. The boy had a soccer ball that he carried around almost wherever he went. When I saw the ball, I hesitated. I hesitated because I knew that the language barrier would annoy me. I approached him anyways. Then an amazing thing happened. The guy, without hesitation, passed me the ball. We juggled the ball back and forth for a while. He would perform a trick and pass. I would do the exact same trick that he did and add one of my own. Then he would mimic mine and add one. We played and played without much words being exchanged. He talked in @CAPS2 and I talked in @CAPS3, and strangely, it felt like we somewhat understood each other. And the laughter, oh, the laughter we had!  One the second day when I arrived at the work station, the first thing I looked for was my new buddy. He was not there; he was still at school. So under the blazing sun, I went to work. After a couple hours, my favorite time of the day came: the lunch time. Oh, the sweet taste of the short @DATE1 was priceless. While we were eating our lunch, I saw my friend walking up the hill. The lunch was almost over by then, so I did not get to play with him. However, he invited me to come play soccer with him. Without hesitation, I gave him a nod. After that though, I was worried. I can't speak @CAPS2, so there wouldn't be much communication between the team members and me. Knowing that communication is crucial in every team sports, I was even more worried. After the work was over, I went to play soccer on the little field. There were lots of guys playing already. We were introduced to the players, and we found out that one of them speaks fluent @CAPS3. He told us not to worry if we can't understand them and that they are just having fun; and the fun began. As we started playing, there weren't much exchanges of words, but there was something greater being exchanged: the laughter. Whenever someone would perform a cool trick and beat the defender or fail miserably, we would laugh and laugh. In the duration of the game, I started to feel as if I had known these guys forever. On that day, I had the privilege of knowing the most passionate people towards the sport that I love the most, and I don't even know their names. It didn't matter, though. I received the most precious gift: friendship. How could anyone say that there is something greater out there than friendship? On that day, I realized how I can make friends without much effort; a truthful laughter was all I needed. After our work was done in @LOCATION2, we drove back to the @CAPS6. While we were crossing that border once again, I noticed that my prospective towards things have been changed noticeably. I no longer saw the one world being better than the other. They were still different: in one world, people have all the things they want, yet are not content.

One the second day when I arrived at the work station, the first thing I looked for was my new buddy. He was not there; he was still at school. So under the blazing sun, I went to work. After a couple hours, my favorite time of the day came: the lunch time. Oh, the sweet taste of the short @DATE1 was priceless. While we were eating our lunch, I saw my friend walking up the hill. The lunch was almost over by then, so I did not get to play with him. However, he invited me to come play soccer with him. Without hesitation, I gave him a nod. After that though, I was worried. I can't speak @CAPS2, so there wouldn't be much communication between the team members and me. Knowing that communication is crucial in every team sports, I was even more worried. After the work was over, I went to play soccer on the little field. There were lots of guys playing already. We were introduced to the players, and we found out that one of them speaks fluent @CAPS3. He told us not to worry if we can't understand them and that they are just having fun; and the fun began. As we started playing, there weren't much exchanges of words, but there was something greater being exchanged: the laughter. Whenever someone would perform a cool trick and beat the defender or fail miserably, we would laugh and laugh. In the duration of the game, I started to feel as if I had known these guys forever. On that day, I had the privilege of knowing the most passionate people towards the sport that I love the most, and I don't even know their names. It didn't matter, though. I received the most precious gift: friendship. How could anyone say that there is something greater out there than friendship? On that day, I realized how I can make friends without much effort; a truthful laughter was all I needed. After our work was done in @LOCATION2, we drove back to the @CAPS6. While we were crossing that border once again, I noticed that my prospective towards things have been changed noticeably. I no longer saw the one world being better than the other. They were still different: in one world, people have all the things they want, yet are not content.

We had been planning for us to hangout but since my dad was gone for the @DATE2 and her moms birthday on the same day we had no where to go. We finally decided to stay at my house. We were just two typical teenagers haven fun. @PERSON1 was that paranoid type. I remember walking by the door and knocking on it while she was on the computer, it scared her so much I laughed so hard. She laughed too but was holding a grudge against me the whole night. We finally settled in after drinking some energy drinks to stay awake. We decided to play a game called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. To play the game you need @NUM2 or more players. I prefer more players because its more fun and you get tons of laughter. You pull a card and on the card it says a phrase that's mixed up kinda like a tongue twister. On the flip side of the card is the correct phrase. You have your partner read the card and try to guess what the phrase says. Its hilarious because the person reading the card has no idea what he/she is saying but you can. The idea of the game is that its not what you say, its what you hear.  I pull a card for @ORGANIZATION1 to read. The side of the card I read says the phrase ""@CAPS3 of soap"" and the flip side of the card that @PERSON1 was reading says ""@CAPS4 soap"". As soon as she reads the phrase I start laughing! I don't think I have ever laughed so hard in my life! @PERSON1 keeps saying and keeps saying it over and over again.

I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I'm thankful for the laughing times we have together and who knows a simple game can turn a normal family setting into great fun. Not only do you bond with your family and friends, you learn a lot about them. I do believe laughter is an important part in any relationship.

""@CAPS8, I forgot about that one."" @CAPS5 replied. I chuckled a little more.   @PERSON1 and I have a lot of great memories because of laughter. It seems like everyday we always have something to look back on and laugh about. I feel it's helped us become best friends over time. We laugh a lot together and always joke around about those times. Laughter is important in any friendship, but it's also important in family relationships too. My brother and I share weird experiences together, we'll laugh about the most random things and also look back on those memories. It brings us much more closer together. Lastly, laughter is important in a love relationship. My boyfriend and I always have something to laugh about wherever we go. It seems like everytime I am with him we just see or hear something funny. We have a lot of memories together and just like my relationship with @PERSON1 and my brother, it's brought us closer and happier.   Laughter is the key to happiness, it's important in any kind of relationship. Most of my memories are made from just laughing. Not only does it create memories, but it also creates happiness. It's like medicine, usually when I'm sad my friends cheer me up by trying to make me laugh. Some people also laugh when they're in a nervous situation, they just don't know how to cope with the awkward situation so they laugh to hide that they are nervous. I feel that laughing will also bring two people closer together, as I said before, it creates memories. Having memories with someone will build a stronger relationship with them. Which is @CAPS7 it's an important part in any relationship. I agree with ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", it definitely is. Laughter holds a lot of power, but I also feel it holds bad power too. Laughter can make some people feel bad.

17,21656,8," Laughter is one of the best elements in my life. I know that without laughter I wouldn'@CAPS1 be happy or even myself at all. Laughing or making someone laugh can just change your day and make it better that's really why I enjoy it, and that's also why I believe that it's an important part of any relationship. My friends and I have so many memories and times where we can look back and remember laughing so hard that we just might pee. Here's just one story where laughter was a big part of our @TIME1. One nice @DATE1 @TIME1 my friends (@PERSON2, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1) and I were having a sleepover at @ORGANIZATION1's house and we were very bored and needed something to do. So like any other sleepover we made a list of fun things to do. One of the first things on the list was to do makeovers. So we did our make-up but not how we usually would though, instead we took all the bright colors of eye shadow that we could find and started to make different designs and shapes all over our faces. Sometime during the makeover @PERSON2 wanted to use some glitter for her face but in was in this small little container and it was very hard to open. We all gave it a try in opening the glitter but finally @PERSON1 tried it one last time and right when she opened it the glitter spilled everywhere! It was so funny, we all started cracking up laughing. It was literally everywhere, all over the bathroom floor and even in our hair. We all took some glitter so that it wouldn'@CAPS1 @CAPS2 to waste. As we were finishing up on our makeovers it was time to take pictures. All of us were wearing pretty sun dresses and now that our make up was done it completed our outfits. So there we were taking pictures and making funny faces making each other laugh, we call it our photo shoot since we always take a bunch of pictures.  Once we were done taking pictures we decided to make a funny video. We would just make up characters and pretend things like as if we were on a @CAPS1.V show and that we would be having a special performer on the show. Silly things like that made us laugh so much it @MONTH1 sound stupid but it really made us laugh and we were having a good time. I remember this specific time when @PERSON2 and I were the hosts and my name was waffles and @PERSON2's was toast, and the performer that we introduced was hash-browns and ketchup. Silly things like that, that really didn'@CAPS1 make sense made us laugh and laugh all @TIME1 long. After our little video we started to get hungry so we decided to have a picnic. Even though it was already dark outside we decided that it wouldn'@CAPS1 be a real picnic if it wasn'@CAPS1 outside. So we grabbed all the blankets that we could find and placed them on the ground on the porch. Since @LOCATION1 is such a fabulous chef she made all of our food. She made her specialty macaroni and cheese, for a healthy appetizer she brought some fresh fruit, and I believe that she made popcorn too just in case we wanted to watch a movie. Of course our meals together are far from normal. @PERSON2 is a very competitive person so whenever she was the chance to compete with someone she takes it. during our meal @PERSON2 asks if anyone would like to have a macaroni eating contest with her, and right away I agreed that I wanted to. We both had a small bowl of @LOCATION1's macaroni and when @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS2!"" the competition was on. Right when we started @LOCATION1 was making silly comments and cracking jokes so I would start laughing, and it worked. As I struggled to finish my bowl @PERSON2 was already done. What could I say, she must have had a bigger appetite than me that @TIME1. That sleepover was one of the most memorable and funny one's that I could think of. Whoever said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" they were right.

In my life I like to laugh a lot because it shows off my happiness inside.   Laughing helps digest food, not only is laughing healthy for you, but it can also cheer people up. When somebody is down or has been crying, a great way to make them feel better is to make them laugh. When I laugh or somebody makes me laugh, I feel warm and fuzzy inside and happier. I think I laugh the most when I'm around all my friends. When I'm around my friend's, it seems we laugh about the silliest things. I like hearing people laugh. When I hear people laugh I get to see there smiley faces.   On the other hand laughing can sometimes be a negative thing and make situations worse. Like telling a joke it can go to ways. If you are telling blonde jokes and a person with blonde hair is around eavesdropping, they might not think the joke is funny. Laughing can also be a negative thing if your laughing at someone and making fun of them.  When I eat my dinner, I eat at the kitchen table with my family. I like eating at the dinner table just some times it can be a little awkward. When I'm eating dinner with my family we talk about odd things, and we laugh a lot.

By this time I was laying on the floor in the living room geting ready to fall asleep becuase it was getting late and my eyes were starting to get heavy whe all of a sudden my mom and brother and sister started to laugh so hard they almost fell out of their seats. So that made me want to look at the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 as I looked I started laughting so hard I started to cry. On the @CAPS4 we were on the beach in @LOCATION1 and me and my little brother were near the water playing in the sand. Everytime the water came close I would run back and scream and my little brother would do the same. When I would walk back to the spot I was at here came my little brother fallowing behind me. But that wasn't the funny part. The funny part was one time that me and my brother were down playing in the sand and just as my mom said ""darn were not going to get that @LOCATION2's @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4..."" a big wave came up to us and I didn't see it but @CAPS1 when it hit us i started running and my little brother followed behind but I accidentally smacked him with my arm and he fell @CAPS1 into the water. It was the @CAPS2 thing I've seen for a while. I felt so bad but all of us were waiting for it to happen. It was probably the best @CAPS3 @CAPS4 picked out by my mom so far.

21,21661,8," The air was cold and @CAPS1 felt as if @CAPS1 was nipping at my skin. Even though @CAPS2 walked beside me, and I knew that @CAPS2 was colder than I, I couldn't help @CAPS3 imagine burying myself in his warm and comforting black jacket. Walking through the gardens of the park, we kept a space of overflowing tension between us. My entire body was annealed and my heart was practically pounding through my chest in pure agitation. I wanted to look at him, directly at his face and straight into his blue-green eyes. I wanted to try and find something to tip me in on what @CAPS2 was feeling at this very moment; @CAPS3 I didn't dare even sneak a glance. I was afraid that my eyes would reveal all that I dream of and how much I love him. The boy who had moved here over the @DATE1 and came into my life by simply replying to a note I had written in hesitance. The one who's made me cry, smile, laugh and scream in agony. The one who's unknowingly brought me down to my knees in mercy of the emotion known as love; the very thing I had come to realize that I was deathly afraid of. Now there @CAPS2 was, walking beside me in a water drenched wonderland. The sky was gray, with clouds plump with rain that fell lightly. @CAPS1 soaked the ground and made the trees glisten. @CAPS1 was beautiful, @CAPS3 even though @CAPS1 was as such, there was still that hint of sadness. At least @CAPS1 fit the mood that drowned our auras as we walked. I led him farther through the gardens until we reached a vast clearing. Still in a calm hush we walked until we reached a small white gazebo with a view of the river swiftly rushing by only a few feet away. I sat down on a bench that wrapped around a circular post in the middle of @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 quietly sat down near me. The moment was awkward, @CAPS3 after a few minutes we started talking. No later had ten minutes passed, when @CAPS2 began to open most of himself up to me. @CAPS2 told me stories of his life, which weren't the least bit happy in any way, shape or form. Most times they made me want to cry because they broke my heart and tore me to shreds. I know @CAPS1 seems kind of pathetic, @CAPS3 having a rocky past myself, my heart and sense of personality has been twisted and bathed in sensitivity. With that sense of metamorphosis, I've come to be a better person. I care more and worry about the people I love. @CAPS1's honestly just who I am. After a couple hours of this, @CAPS1 soon became silent again. I finally looked over at him only to see him staring down intently at his hands with his back slightly turned to me. His medium-length blond hair covered his face, hiding the view of his expression. His entire body was shaking, and even though the wind was chilly, I knew that @CAPS2 wasn't shaking because of @CAPS1. There was more to @CAPS1 than that, I was sure of @CAPS1. After a few minutes of debating on what I should do, I slowly raised my hand and rested @CAPS1 on his shoulder. His shaking stopped instantly. Time seemed to pass by quickly after that, and the next thing I knew we were both standing and simply hugging each other. ""I'm sorry that things have been so bad for you."" I whispered. ""@CAPS1 isn't your fault."" @CAPS2 replied, hugging me tighter. I nodded slightly, @CAPS3 deep inside I still felt the same. I still wished that I could bring him happiness, and I guess after all this hard work I've been putting myself through, I'm slowly getting there. After we finally released the hug, I looked around and noticed that the air was getting warmer and patches of blue sky and rays of sunlight were beginning to force their way through the clouds. I was smiling at the sight when @CAPS2 brought up the subject of chocolate. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS1's your money!"" I exclaimed, biting my lower lip and looking down at my feet. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS1's my money. So what do you think? Want some chocolate?"" ""@CAPS5... sure, why not?"" I mumbled with a smile at the corners of my lips, and we headed back through the gardens. Things were more relaxed then. We laughed nonstop as we talked about things that weren't so serious, such as how clumsy we are @CAPS3 yet are still able to maintain being 'ninjas'. To this day, we have been together for fifty-six days, and our relationship is strong.  How is @CAPS1 possible? Well, despite our horrific pasts, the element of laughter that sneaks its way through into our moments together is what seems to be the thing that holds us together, even when the world turns its back on us. And to be sincerely honest, I hope @CAPS1 keeps a tight grip on us for years to come.",24661,41,55,1015,4575,3.678817734,18.45454545, the air was cold and felt as if was nipping at my skin  even though walked beside me  and i knew that was colder than i  i couldn t help imagine burying myself in his warm and comforting black jacket  walking through the gardens of the park  we kept a space of overflowing tension between us  my entire body was annealed and my heart was practically pounding through my chest in pure agitation  i wanted to look at him  directly at his face and straight into his blue green eyes  i wanted to try and find something to tip me in on what was feeling at this very moment  i didn t dare even sneak a glance  i was afraid that my eyes would reveal all that i dream of and how much i love him  the boy who had moved here over the and came into my life by simply replying to a note i had written in hesitance  the one who s made me cry  smile  laugh and scream in agony  the one who s unknowingly brought me down to my knees in mercy of the emotion known as love  the very thing i had come to realize that i was deathly afraid of  now there was  walking beside me in a water drenched wonderland  the sky was gray  with clouds plump with rain that fell lightly  soaked the ground and made the trees glisten  was beautiful  even though was as such  there was still that hint of sadness  at least fit the mood that drowned our auras as we walked  i led him farther through the gardens until we reached a vast clearing  still in a calm hush we walked until we reached a small white gazebo with a view of the river swiftly rushing by only a few feet away  i sat down on a bench that wrapped around a circular post in the middle of and quietly sat down near me  the moment was awkward  after a few minutes we started talking  no later had ten minutes passed  when began to open most of himself up to me  told me stories of his life  which weren t the least bit happy in any way  shape or form  most times they made me want to cry because they broke my heart and tore me to shreds  i know seems kind of pathetic  having a rocky past myself  my heart and sense of personality has been twisted and bathed in sensitivity  with that sense of metamorphosis  i ve come to be a better person  i care more and worry about the people i love  honestly just who i am  after a couple hours of this  soon became silent again  i finally looked over at him only to see him staring down intently at his hands with his back slightly turned to me  his medium length blond hair covered his face  hiding the view of his expression  his entire body was shaking  and even though the wind was chilly  i knew that wasn t shaking because of there was more to than that  i was sure of after a few minutes of debating on what i should do  i slowly raised my hand and rested on his shoulder  his shaking stopped instantly  time seemed to pass by quickly after that  and the next thing i knew we were both standing and simply hugging each other   i m sorry that things have been so bad for you   i whispered    caps isn t your fault   replied  hugging me tighter  i nodded slightly  deep inside i still felt the same  i still wished that i could bring him happiness  and i guess after all this hard work i ve been putting myself through  i m slowly getting there  after we finally released the hug  i looked around and noticed that the air was getting warmer and patches of blue sky and rays of sunlight were beginning to force their way through the clouds  i was smiling at the sight when brought up the subject of chocolate    caps your money   i exclaimed  biting my lower lip and looking down at my feet    caps  my money  so what do you think  want some chocolate     caps    sure  why not   i mumbled with a smile at the corners of my lips  and we headed back through the gardens  things were more relaxed then  we laughed nonstop as we talked about things that weren t so serious  such as how clumsy we are yet are still able to maintain being  ninjas   to this day  we have been together for fifty six days  and our relationship is strong   how is possible  well  despite our horrific pasts  the element of laughter that sneaks its way through into our moments together is what seems to be the thing that holds us together  even when the world turns its back on us  and to be sincerely honest  i hope keeps a tight grip on us for years to come ,1034,119,134,128,60,28,63,144,6,"The air was cold and @CAPS1 felt as if @CAPS1 was nipping at my skin.

22,21664,8," Everybody laughs, its a way of life, there are times when people laugh at the right moments @CAPS5 they sometimes laugh at the wrong moments @CAPS5 make someone they care about mad at them. Everyone has a different sense of humor, like me I have a twisted sense of humor, if you have ever watched the @CAPS1 series @CAPS5 thought that it was horrible, well I love those movies they are my favorite I don't know why but I just seem to like gore movies. I laugh at them because of how crazy the traps are @CAPS5 think its insane how smart the guy is. But that has nothing to do with the story that I am about to tell you. Well one day I was hanging out with my friends @CAPS5 @CAPS2 was @NUM1 days away @CAPS5 we all decided to go to the haunted corn maze in @LOCATION1. So the next day we all got together at about @NUM2 pm at my friend @PERSON2's house because his mom offered to drive us there so we all got into the car @CAPS5 left. About an hour or so later we pulled up to the corn maze, payed the entry fee @CAPS5 ran in. @CAPS5 before I go any further there is something I have to say about myself, I am very jumpy sometimes @CAPS5 when something jumps out my first instinct is to bring it down @CAPS5 run, now back to the story.  We went into the maze @CAPS5 we had to go through this little building thing @CAPS5 when we went in about @NUM3 people dressed in costumes like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @LOCATION2, @CAPS5 some other things I don't remember jumped out @CAPS5 scared everybody, @CAPS5 me @CAPS5 my friends all jump but my friend @PERSON2 screams @CAPS5 we all run deeper into the corn maze @CAPS5 when we were finally alone everyone turns around @CAPS5 looks at @PERSON2 @CAPS5 starts laughing really hard @CAPS5 @PERSON2 looks at me @CAPS5 says ""whats so funny!?"" @CAPS5 I said ""@CAPS6! You screamed like a little girl back there!"" @CAPS5 everybody starts laughing again @CAPS5 continues through the maze. So eventually we get to the halfway marker in the middle of the corn maze @CAPS5 there are @NUM4 port-a-potties lined up @CAPS5 my friend @PERSON1 says she has to go to the bathroom, so everyone stops @CAPS5 she starts walking towards it @CAPS5 when she is about @NUM4 feet from it a horn goes off @CAPS5 a pressure washer thing taped to the top of the port-a-potty soaks her, @CAPS5 while she is screaming @NUM1 guys with chainsaws (there is no chain on them) runs out from behind the port-a-potty's @CAPS5 starts chasing after everybody. So we run away @CAPS5 about @NUM7 minutes later we come to this tunnel that's painted pitch black on the walls so you cant see, with some of the fastest blinking strobe lights I have ever seen! While were standing outside of it some more people dressed in costumes with chainsaws jump out @CAPS5 we all run into the tunnel. Everybody finds there way out without any problems but me because while I was running inside it I accidentally ran into the wall @CAPS5 fell on my butt. So I get back up @CAPS5 find my way out. When I get out I see the end of the corn maze ahead through a tunnel that will make you lose your balance cause you walk along a platform @CAPS5 the tunnel is spinning around you.

23,21665,8," Have you ever laughed so much and you can't stop laughing, but you have no idea why you can't stop? This happens to me all the time. Most of the people around me get annoyed, but sometimes they'll join in on my non-stop laughing spree. Thinking about laughing takes me back to one of the many nights that my laughter wouldn't stop. Seeing @ORGANIZATION1 sitting next to @CAPS1 giving me the evil eye that @CAPS3, on most cases, make me cower. This wasn't one of those times though, for I was on a laughing frenzy and there was no stopping me.  That night @PERSON1 came over to hang out and I had a great day so of course I was going to be in a great mood. @ORGANIZATION1, who was already annoyed that day, sat on the couch beside @CAPS1, her boyfriend, and talked about how annoying I am when @PERSON1's over since I can never stop laughing. @PERSON1 and I sat on the couch and talked about our days, how @PERSON2's laugh was starting to get on my last nerve. I imitated the loud laugh and made both of us burst into laughter. @ORGANIZATION1 looked over from the @ORGANIZATION2 and glared at me until the laughing died down a little bit.  Then the tickle war began, which I of course started. I unfortunately lost the war since he was able to have tickled my feet, the most ticklish spot I have. I rolled around on the couch laughing, my eyes watered a little, when I crashed onto the living room floor. @PERSON3, our dog, stood up from where @CAPS4 was laying and jumped on me. I squirmed on the ground laughing as @CAPS4 tried to lick my face and @PERSON1 tickled my feet. ""@CAPS3 you just shut up @PERSON4!"" @ORGANIZATION1 yelled, obviously annoyed with my laughing.  I picked @PERSON3's toy up and threw it across the room, @CAPS4 ran after it, so I had enough time to hop back up on the couch. I put my face down on the couch and giggled into the cushion so that @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 calm down. After ten minutes of giggling I decided I wanted a chocolate cupcake to feed my hungry stomach. I grabbed one out of the box and sat back down on the couch. When I sat down the chocolate shavings on top of the cupcake fell off and down my shirt. @PERSON1 laughed at me and looked at me like I was crazy which made me laugh even more. I took the cupcake and smeared the chocolate frosting all over his face. I laughed for a moment then he took the frosting that was smeared on his face and wiped it on mine. I sat on the couch laughed and licked the frosting off my hands that I cleaned off my face.  He got his payback and tickled my ribs and I flopped onto the floor again. @PERSON3 ran from the backroom and jumped on me, @CAPS4 tried to lick my face but I kept it covered from her slobber. After a moment of no tickling I crawled back up on the couch and giggled in the cushions for another half hour. @PERSON1 gave me the look as if I was crazy since there was no reason for me to have been laughing. @ORGANIZATION1 glared at me even more but I just laughed more. I stood up to go get my drink from the table, but I was quickly on the ground again when I tripped on a pillow. I burst into laughter all over again, I rolled around on the ground for five minutes. ""@PERSON4, @CAPS3 you stop acting like a ditz and be normal instead of putting on this stupid act since your boyfriend's over!"" @ORGANIZATION1 yelled from the kitchen.  I stopped laughing, rolled over and looked her directly in the eyes. With playful anger and giggling I said to her, ""shut up and stop being so mean @ORGANIZATION1."" I smiled and stood up from the living room floor. @ORGANIZATION1's eyes burned into the back of my head as I hopped back onto the couch beside @LOCATION1. ""@CAPS4's just jealous,"" he said with a smile. I laughed but stopped and tried not to annoy @ORGANIZATION1 for the rest of the night. @CAPS4 decided to go to @CAPS1's house so that @CAPS4 wouldn't have to listen to me laugh for another second, which worked for me so I could laugh all I wanted without her glaring at me. The rest of the night was peaceful. We sat and talked and laughed about our day. There was another tickle war which I finally won, I still laughed uncontrollably.

I personally live by the aspect of laughter. Making people laugh has gotten me many great friends even best friends, maybe even a few boyfriends. Any relationship no matter weather its just friendly or you like the person is brought together through laughter. Meaning that laughter can always ease some tension between two people or even a group of people. When I first started school I used laughter to make new friends, and to get them to like me. When I was in kinder-garden I was on the bus with a girl named @PERSON1 and I wanted to say something to her but I wasn't sure what to say so I decided to go with a joke. Of course it made her laugh then her laughing made me laugh. We laughed until one of us got off the bus, it happened to be her that got off the bus first. She was still laughing when she stepped off the bus. I wondered if that would be the only time we would talk. Little did I know it was the start of a great friendship. When I got home I told my mom all about what happened and then she asked if I met any new friends at school. I told her all about what happened on the bus and she told me that with my jokes she would be surprised if I didn't have a million friends by the end of the week.  The very next day when I got on the bus guess who I saw, @PERSON1, sitting there smiling and waving to me to come sit with her, so I went and sat down next to her. She asked me to tell her that joke I told her yesterday. I then told her the joke then she told me one of her jokes, we laughed tell we got to school. That whole day we were inseparable. We sat next to each other at story time and at snack time and then again on the bus ride home. It turned out it wasn't just that day we would be inseparable it was the whole school year and that whole @DATE1 fallowing that we were like two peas in a pod. When the next school year rolled around we found out we weren't in the same class any more and we only got to hang out on the bus and at recess cause we were in the first grade and we got recess then. For the next few years it would be this way where we only got to hang out while on the bus or out on the play ground. After a few years our bus routs changed and we then no longer rode the same bus but we still knew we were best friends cause we still had that best friend bond. On special weekends if we were lucky and good little girls our parents would let us go to each others houses to play and hang out, we would usually talk them into letting us stay the night too. We had many more funny moments, more then I can describe.  Once we got to middle school we hung out more and had the same friends, we even participated in the same activities such as band and sports. During those last few years tell high school we were close again. Us being the two goof balls that we are made a few more friends that liked the same sports and actives we did and thought the same jokes were funny that we thought were funny. We would all get together after a sporting even and talk about what happened during the game and laugh about the funny things that happened to us or the other team and maybe crack a few jokes about someone on the other team, you know girls just being girls. Activities like this went on tell right before high school started. Since high school started @PERSON1 and I still keep in touch, we have had a few classes together here and there but not a whole lot.  Hanna and I are still friends to this day and it wouldn't have been for that day on the bus where I decided to crack a joke and make her laugh for us to become friends. People usually say that it all started with a laugh or a joke. Laughter really can bring two people together, weather you stay friends for a long time or just a year, you can always recall how you met that person.

Laughter has always been a huge part of my life, it's something that I feed on and that helps me through everyday. One of the greatest day of my life revolved around just laughter alone. It was the @DATE1 that I had to take my friend, @PERSON4's senior pictures. It was @DATE2 @TIME1 and I had gotten a text from @PERSON4 who had asked me to take her senior pictures, so I agreed and invited two of my friends @PERSON1 and @LOCATION2. We all met up at my house and decided that we would take her pictures the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The ride was long, but certainly not boring. It was hysterical. We were laughing and joking about almost anything for no reason. When we finally reached @CAPS1 @CAPS2, it was raining, so we decided to take fun pictures instead. The pictures were hilarious and you could tell we were having tons of fun. When we were soaked from the rain we decided to leave, but we didn't want the day to end, so we came up with the most fun, entertaining plan ever: to scare our other friends at their movie party. But for this, we needed an expert. Our friend @PERSON2. Our plan was simple: get @CAPS5 @CAPS6, wait til dark, dress in black, scare the poop out of our friends, and also get a person on the inside. And since the party was at @ORGANIZATION1's house, we decided to let her in on it. We arrived at @ORGANIZATION1's house at around @TIME2, so it was really dark. We turned off the headlights to @PERSON4's car so that no one could see that we were coming and pulled halfway down @ORGANIZATION1's driveway. We stealth-mode crawled the rest of the way laughing the entire time. We decided that first: I would call them @NUM1 or @NUM2 times and when they answered I would hang up.

I sat down by a very shy girl. Her named just happened to be @PERSON2. I glanced at her and caught her eye. She said hello to me. That's where it all began. One day, @PERSON2 and I walked into the classroom together to start the new day of school. Our teacher had assigned us a project that had to do with glue. We sat down next to a girl named @LOCATION1. She was a short, light brown hair girl, who we thought was a little strange. During the time we were working on our project, we tried to talk to @LOCATION1, but instead of her talking to us, she swiftly picked up a glue stick, took of the cap, and started eating it. The room went silent and @PERSON2 and I burst into laughter. Third grade came around, and @PERSON2 and I were still bestfriends. We were getting older, and in our minds, more mature. We started hanging out with different people, and playing seperate games at recess, making not much time for eachother. We missed eachother, so I told her we needed to stay close because I wanted her to be my bestfriend for life. She was truely the best friend I had could have ever asked for. I remember one day at recess, when @PERSON2 was hanging out with a different set of friends then I. My friends and I were playing four sqaure. @PERSON2 got mad at me for not playing with her, and that was our first fight. I didn't understand why she was so mad about not playing, because she could have waited her turn in line. I went home and cried to my mom. She told me not to worry, because we were such good friends that nothing, not even a little fight, could make us no longer friends. The next day, she came up to me and said she was sorry. We hugged and started to laugh. @PERSON2 was truley, my best friend. Sixth grade hit. And we were still good friends. We picked all the same classes to be into together. We had @CAPS1.E and band. @PERSON2 and I chose to pick the clarinet to play. A very challenging looking insrument to play. We went to the meeting together, to rent our clarients from @ORGANIZATION1.

28,21671,8,"  I would say that if people didnt laugh in this world then there would be no point of being happy. Laughter is an important element in .life because it makes people be happy, excited, etc. Me and my friends always laugh and makes jokes, but when we dont its like theres no point in even talking, its very hard to explain.  One time me and one of my friends were arguing about something that was very pointless, but anyways, we started to make up jokes and laugh and our problem was pretty much solved even though when we really thought about it , it wasnt. Me and my friends argue about random things all the time, or are mad at eachother for something but to solve our problems we laugh and start thinking about something funny because if we were still arguing it wouldnt really go anywhere. For example it wouldnt solve our situation. And its true when people say that laughter is an important part of any relationship because if there wasnt laughter in your relationships then you would be serious all the time and it wouldnt come out as a good relationship. Theres times when me and my mom argue, like its not a really big problem, but when i laugh it off and start making jokes, we get along more, its a way of our relationship to work. I dont mean that whenever theres a problem in your life you always have to laugh it off and just forget about it but when your always serious about everything it doesnt always come out good, or makes everything better.

30,21673,8," My best friend, @PERSON1, and I have had many unforgettable memories which has made our friendship really close. When @PERSON1 and I were first becoming best friends we found a saying that stated ""the more you laugh, the longer you'll live."" @CAPS1 that saying is true then @PERSON1 and I will live to be very old continuing being happy and making our friendship even stronger than it is now. We have had many times where we have laughed so hard we cried but i will never forget, even when I'm @NUM1 years old, when @PERSON1 and I both fell on our butts within one hour. It all began when @PERSON1 and I were walking to my house for lunch on a cold @DATE1 day. The high school stairs were all frozen over, they were like a sheet of ice. Arms locked, legs shaking, @PERSON1 and I slowly started walking down the eight flight of stairs. Halfway down the stairs we got overly confident and we let go of each other thinking that nothing bad was going to happen. When we got to the steepest flight of stairs, the last flight, @PERSON1 took a step and her feet slipped out from under her and she slid down the frozen stairs like a little kid sliding down a water slide. Laughing, worrying, and running, I hurried to the bottom of the stairs, where @PERSON1 had landed, to see @CAPS1 she was okay. @PERSON1, embarrassed and terrified, was laughing so hard she was crying. She jumped up like a @DATE2, she was more worried that people saw her than she was about being hurt. Luckily no one was near and she wasn't hurt a bit. We laughed for @NUM2 minutes straight with tears running down our cold, red faces.  When we safely got back up to the school, after eating lunch at my house, I started telling everyone what happened. After the lunch bell rang we headed to our fifth period class which was gym class, karma came at the wrong time. Our whole class was working out together, we were doing yoga. We each had our yoga mats on the ground scattered everywhere. To warm up we had to do @NUM3 jumping jacks and ten push ups, I made a blunder. I got up to do my @NUM3 jumping jacks and i didn't realize my mat was right next to me. On my seventh jumping jack my right foot stepped on my mat and the mat starting sliding away from me. With my foot stuck on the mat I couldn't do anything about it, i ended up doing the splits and falling on my butt in front of the whole class. Immediately everyone started laughing at me, @PERSON1 was laughing so hard she ended up on the floor with me. Once again, @PERSON1 and I laughed for another @NUM2 minutes straight. We definitely got a workout that day, because we were laughing so hard our abs started to extremely hurt. From that day on, I have realized that there is such thing as karma. I learned my lesson, I will never laugh or make fun of someone for falling ever again. Even though @PERSON1 and I both mortified ourselves that day, we will never forget that memory we had together. To me, laughter is the medicine to life. Laughing has caused my best friend and I to become so much closer and has made us realize that being unhappy gets you nowhere but being happy gets you anywhere.

I would do anything for this girl, and she would do anything for me. Our whole relationship is based on love, laughter, and more love. It seems to me that we never are in a bad mood when we are with each other, never sad always happy. When me and @CAPS1 first met it was not on very good terms. She was best friends with my ex girl friend and my ex girl friend didn't like me to much. I was at a school dance when i first saw her, she was absolutely beautiful in her blue dress and i stared at her for about @NUM1 minutes when she finally looked at me. she had this look of sadness on her face and i didn't really understand it. later that night i got the courage to go and ask her to dance and she said yes! We danced for the rest of the night because i guess we had this good connection. @CAPS1 and i have always had a connection from then on. After the dance i did not want to leave this girl because i feared i would never get to talk to her again so i asked for her number. She said yes and she had a great time, witch made me very happy because she was not sad anymore. Later that week i would try talking to her in the halls at school and for some reason couldn't get her to engage in a conversation. So i decided to call her on @DATE2 to ask her on a date. she told me no and that i should stop bothering her because her best friend hates me and that wouldn't be very good for there relationship. Finally after hours of talking on the phone i asked her to not tell anyone about our dater we were going to have on @DATE1. She said yes and that made me the happiest guy on earth. I was walking around my house with my new found swagger because i had a date on @DATE1 with the girl of my dreams. On @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 and i whet bowling at the bowling ally in town. we where both very bad and it was funny watching her bowl. She is not a very strong girl, and watching her try to bowl was very funny. We both laughed for hours that night. Me and her were so happy, i told her we could do this every night and that i would make her the happiest girl ever. @CAPS1 and I proceeded to have these secret dates that where better then anything iv experienced before. Iv slowly started to think we were in a relationship beyond friendship. On the last secret date we had, @CAPS1 asked me the question that i will remember for the rest of my life. Will you be my boy friend?' I was ecstatic, yelling yes, yes! god yes! She was very happy happy as well. I could now go to school and hold this beautiful girls hand and go over to her place and meet her family and start our new relationship. We are now currently still in love and moving very slow. we are hoping to make good decisions after high school and stay together. I think one of the main reasons why me and @CAPS1 got along so well on our dates was the laughter. She can make me laugh at anytime of the day and always cheer me up. I don't know what i would do without her.

32,21675,8," Laughter is a way to make any situation more positive, memorable, and more enjoyable. People can use it to improve their mood in a situation in which they are uncomfortable, scared, or nervous about something. Being in some of these positions I can understand why laughter is so important. A great example would be when I went to @LOCATION3 in the @DATE1. I did things, met people, and achieved some personal goals that I wanted to accomplish, and couldn't have done it without laughing and remembering why I was there. Going to @LOCATION3 was a trip of a lifetime for me and it was one that I will never forget. I will never forget the foods that I tried, the friends I met, and some of the fears that I overcame. The first day we arrived in @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1, I told myself that I wasn't going to turn down any opportunities to try new foods, and this applied to the time I was going to spend in @LOCATION5 as well. I was a little nervous to tell you the truth, but I'm glad that I stuck with my goal. That afternoon, we all went out to do some walking around and shopping. My mom was inside of a restaurant with my coach and some of the other parents. I had to get money from her to buy a gift for my little sister that I thought would bring a piece of @LOCATION4 home with me. So I went inside to ask her, but my coach told me that I had to try what he was eating before I could have the money. I thought, opportunity!I asked what he was eating and he told me that it was @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 and that it was so amazing. He gave me a bite that had a little bit of everything on it. As soon as I had the @CAPS1 in my mouth, I wanted to spit it right back out. After I painfully swallowed the bite, I had a look on my face that made it clear to everyone that I did not acquire a taste for @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1. All the parents laughed and my coach laughed the most. I could not help but laugh myself because I could only imagine the look on my face when I first discovered that the @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 was really @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 @CAPS1. While we were in @LOCATION4, we played a friendly soccer match against one of @LOCATION4's home teams. It was our first game of our trip and everyone was really excited. We wanted not only to play soccer, but to meet new people from another country that we had something in common with, and that was our passion for soccer. The match ended with a score of six to one, our team coming out on top with a victory. Of course we wanted to win, but that wasn't our priority. We wanted to have fun. After we shook hands with the other players, we wanted to exchange pendants and t-shirts so that they would never forget the team that came from @LOCATION2. We were all happy and you could tell that we were having the time of our lives. Everyone stayed on the field just talking to them and messing around with each other., taking pictures, and playing a few fun soccer games that they thought us. Some of our girls showed off their @CAPS7 accents, and girls from the @LOCATION4 team tried out their ""@CAPS8 voices"", so they call it. They would say some pretty insane things that they thought were phrases we said on a regular basis. None of us could stop laughing because of their poor imitations. They kept yelling, ""yeah snowboarding!"" I really didn't know why exactly, but I guess to them it was something we said all the time. We stayed and talked to them for hours until it was dark.

That's why when I forgot my lines in our middle school production ofThe @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON3, I felt like dying. In my opinion, the ability of being able to laugh at yourself is one of the best qualities a person can have. Even if the whole country is laughing at you (or the entire seventh grade class, in my case) if you can laugh along with them it makes everything seem so much better. Being a teenage girl, not only do embarrassing events happen what feels like daily, but at this age these things seem to matter so much more. Because of reputations and the prospect of popularity always looming over you, a simple trip, misspoken word, or stain on your jacket seems like the end of the world. Sometimes, if you're lucky, these things can happen in the privacy of your on home, but other times your mistakes happen on display for everyone to see, making the possibility of forgetting it ever happened impossible. If you would have asked me at the time, I would've told you seventh grade was perfect; classes were easy, I had the best friends, and life just seemed to be going my way. That was, of course, before musical theater. It was almost @DATE1 and with the sun shining outside our classroom window the end-of-year excitement was already fully visible. I was in @PERSON1's classroom, the walls decorated with their usual choir theme, surrounded by the best class a person could imagine. We were practicing our play we planned on presenting the very next day, and at the moment I wasn't nervous at all, and maybe that was my first mistake, but if I'm honest with myself the play didn't seem like too big of a deal, and surrounded by my friends how could anything go wrong? That was @CAPS5 a bad move on my part. The day had finally arrived and we were going to be presenting the musical we had all worked so hard on. With everyone dressed in costume and with full makeup on the jitters had seemed to finally move in. ""@CAPS4 you nervous?"" One of my best friends, @PERSON2 asked me. She was playing one of the leads in the play and I knew just how excited she was. I figured I should try to play it cool. ""Of course not, no big deal right? @CAPS4 you?"" I didn't know how she could possibly not be nervous, looking out I saw that the auditorium was full of students and parents there to see us. ""@CAPS5 not! I better go though now, I think were starting."" @PERSON2 responded. Well that settled it then; if @PERSON2 (who's part was practically triple the lines of mine and who had an entire song to herself) wasn't nervous, then I @CAPS5 had no right to be.

With every measure of the music I could feel the moment nearing but I still couldn't remember what I was supposed to say. Then suddenly, it was my turn.  The audience obviously recognized the error in the performance and as I stood on stage I could feel my cheeks reddening. I heard the giggles from my fellow classmates in the audience and it only proceeded to get worse. I would have given anything to not be on that stage right then and instead be sitting with them, but there was nothing I could do about it and I had to move on.  As the first act ended and I got to exit the stage I was finally able to take a deep breath.  Looking at the wall (where our teacher had conveniently posted the script) I read over my lines. I knew this! Every blocking movement and gasp for dramatic effect was lodged in my brain and it seemed impossible that I could forget it once I had walked out on stage. Taking one last moment to look over my lines I walked back out on stage, confident that this time I would not forget my lines. Although to this day when I think of that moment, when I stood on that stage and everyone expectantly waited for my lines, the embarrassment is still palpable I know it's all okay.

We all rush to put our hair up the way we planned.i take out my phone to check the time once my face regains color I gasp were late! @CAPS3 our coach runs in and yells for us to get to the field. we sprint down to the field and the @CAPS2 has already started. I through down my bag and so do the others. We rush @CAPS3 fast @CAPS3 we can to get into our stag. @CAPS3 we stand by the field a gush of wind glides over my bare legs. I shiver in my place @CAPS3 we hurry to find a cheer. When we have found a cheer we all agree on, I'm very stressed. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 calls the cheer i put on a smile and begin to cheer. @CAPS3 we hit the moves my mind suddenly goes blank I can't remember the moves. My face goes stiff @CAPS3 i quickly begin to clasp my hands together. I look over and see almost half the squad confused. I continue to clasp then feel a sharp pain because of how hard i was slamming them together. Once the cheer ends I quickly spirit to the crowd and whip myself around and relax my face. @CAPS3 our coach begins to speak to us we all turn our heads to look at her. She tells us we have to stunt before half time. I glance at the giant clock holding the score, there is only five minutes left in this half of the @CAPS2. I turn to @PERSON1 she nods at me and we begin to spirit to our places so we can stunt. @CAPS3 we are moving into our places the cold winds chills my body. When we set, one foot is handed into @ORGANIZATION1's hand and the other about to jump into mine. I hear the counts that are so familiar to me. @CAPS3 the cold pattern of her shoe slams my hands we push her into a prep. We begin to say the cheer @CAPS3 her foot begins to slide from under my hands. I look and see the same thing is happening to @PERSON1. A flash of fear hits my face @CAPS3 she falls out of our hands. A gasp slips from my lips @CAPS3 her hands brace her fall. Our whole stunt group hurries to pull her up when i notice her back moving up and down rapidly. I assume she is crying, but when we scoop her up she is laughing like crazy. @PERSON1 and I give a confused look to one another and ask her if she is @CAPS4. She states that she is fine and we get back into our stag. Once @CAPS5 calms down @PERSON1 passes down a cheer. When the cheer is passed half way down the line one of the girls changes the cheer. I turn to her and say ""that's not the cheer!"" We all argue about the cheer until our coach yells a cheer to do. Once we finish our cheer I see one of the players running with the ball. I scream at him to run harder! When he is tackled i slam my foot down on the track field and let our a grunting noise. Everyone on the squad looks at me and we all burst our laughing. Once we calm down and wipe the warm tears from our eyes, we turn to the score board and notice we only have two minutes left in the @CAPS2. Realizing our situation our coach through a cheer for us to do. We quickly turn and do our cheer @CAPS3 the buzzer goes off. We clean and spirit once the cheer is over and we turn to the field.

We got right to work. We started by putting the lights on the roof, then moved on to trying to wrestle the tree to sit straight in the stand (I was the one under the tree while @PERSON1 told me which way to adjust, of course) then, we got to making @PERSON1's famous sugar cookies. After adding all of the necessary ingredients we sprinkled flour over the table and started cutting the dough in to miniature santa's and @CAPS1 tree's. Then the war began. @PERSON1 scooped a fingertip of flower and said, ""@CAPS4 @PERSON2,"" ""@CAPS5-,"" I began but was stopped short because as I lifted my head, my nose had collided with with her fingertip making my eyes cross as I watched the puff of white powder protrude from my nose like a miniscule nuclear explosion. I grabbed a palm-full of flour and wiped @CAPS7 down her cheek giving a triumphant ""@CAPS6!"" In turn @CAPS8 grabbed a hearty fist-full and threw @CAPS7 in my face. We spent quite a while giggling and dodging each others attempts to cover one another in the stuff. With our tummy's sore and our eye's wet from laughter we started frosting cookies along with her family members who were slowly but surely arriving at the house. Once all of the cookies had been frosted and strewn around the kitchen to dry we popped in the movieElf and got settled in, surrounded by all of our loved ones. As the movie was coming to @CAPS7's conclusion, our eyelids drooped and a warmth filled our belly's from the cider her mom had made. I was on the verge of sleep, blinking slower everytime, and I saw a fluttering outside the window. Not able to control my curiosity, I groggily stumbled over to the window sill, pushed the curtains aside then turned to @PERSON1 with a giddy grin and whispered, ""@CAPS7's snowing!"" @CAPS8 immediately jumped up to look out the window, we looked at one other, screamed, then sprinted for the front door. Once outside we grabbed each other and jumped up and down in excitement. Then we were silent.

When I arrived the @CAPS2 of, I walked through the door and was enveloped in the inviting smell of pine, the glow of assorted colors of lights and, the warmth of my best friend's tight embrace. We got right to work. We started by putting the lights on the roof, then moved on to trying to wrestle the tree to sit straight in the stand (I was the one under the tree while @PERSON1 told me which way to adjust, of course) then, we got to making @PERSON1's famous sugar cookies. After adding all of the necessary ingredients we sprinkled flour over the table and started cutting the dough in to miniature santa's and @CAPS1 tree's. Then the war began. @PERSON1 scooped a fingertip of flower and said, ""@CAPS4 @PERSON2,"" ""@CAPS5-,"" I began but was stopped short because as I lifted my head, my nose had collided with with her fingertip making my eyes cross as I watched the puff of white powder protrude from my nose like a miniscule nuclear explosion. I grabbed a palm-full of flour and wiped @CAPS7 down her cheek giving a triumphant ""@CAPS6!"" In turn @CAPS8 grabbed a hearty fist-full and threw @CAPS7 in my face. We spent quite a while giggling and dodging each others attempts to cover one another in the stuff. With our tummy's sore and our eye's wet from laughter we started frosting cookies along with her family members who were slowly but surely arriving at the house. Once all of the cookies had been frosted and strewn around the kitchen to dry we popped in the movieElf and got settled in, surrounded by all of our loved ones. As the movie was coming to @CAPS7's conclusion, our eyelids drooped and a warmth filled our belly's from the cider her mom had made. I was on the verge of sleep, blinking slower everytime, and I saw a fluttering outside the window. Not able to control my curiosity, I groggily stumbled over to the window sill, pushed the curtains aside then turned to @PERSON1 with a giddy grin and whispered, ""@CAPS7's snowing!"" @CAPS8 immediately jumped up to look out the window, we looked at one other, screamed, then sprinted for the front door. Once outside we grabbed each other and jumped up and down in excitement. Then we were silent. Watching the snow flutter and spiral through the brisk winter air, both in utter agreement to the words that did not need to be spoken. We had just been gifted with a perfect ending to a perfect @CAPS2.","Everyone has had a best friend at some point. Mine is named @PERSON1, @CAPS8 has dark brown hair and the greatest smile in the world. My best friend and I are quite an odd couple. The things we talk about and the adventures we have are not exactly what you would call normal. The two of us have shared some of my favorite memories, been through some of the toughest times, and laughed a lot. @PERSON1 and I have a lot of differences. @CAPS8 likes to act tough and is a germaphobe. I on the other hand am pretty girly and am not too worried if someone drinks out of my glass. There is one thing that we both absolutely love though. @CAPS1. Everything about @CAPS7 just makes us giddy. We love the lights and the smell of the @CAPS1 tree, the music, everything. So what are two eager girls to do in the middle of @DATE1 with no plans?

38,21681,8,"@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 once said, Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I couldn't agree with them more. Anybody can speak with one another, or even become friends, but laughter is the glue that holds their relationship together. It's such a simple, innocent, action, that can create a lifetime of @CAPS2 between two people. It was @CAPS7 first day of, yet another, new @CAPS5. I was starting to lose count. What was this, the seventh one? Yeah, that seemed about right. This time it was different, though. I wasn't just a little kid anymore with one classroom to sit in all day. Not only was it @CAPS7 first day at a new @CAPS5, it was @CAPS7 first day of @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Where you used binders instead of notebooks. Where you didn't sit in the same desk all day. Where you had a schedule that you had to memorize, and a locker combination as well. Where they only gave you four minutes to get to class on time. Plus, I was back at the bottom of the food chain, this time, with no friends. Nobody I could turn to in class to talk with. Nobody to share a laugh with at lunch. Not only did I not know anybody, I was a nobody.   I scurried into @CAPS7 first class of the day, homeroom. For the first time, I was hoping there was a seating chart so that I didn't have to awkwardly choose @CAPS3 to sit by. Thankfully, @CAPS3 out there thought I deserved a break, and there was. Everybody had cute little name tags planted on their desk with a @CAPS5 planner and a candy bar. I laughed. It seemed like kindergarten all over again, then I thought to myself: ""@CAPS6 this won't be so bad after all."" @CAPS7 eyes swept over all of the thirty-one desks in the room for @CAPS7 name. I found it, smack in the @CAPS4 of the classroom. Realizing I had been standing in the doorway for quite sometime, I quickly walked to @CAPS7 seat and sat down. Waiting for the rest of @CAPS7 classmates to arrive, anxiously anticipating to find out who @CAPS7 neighbors would be.   Finally, everybody was in class, and the bell rang. I glanced around the room. Taking everybody in. Judging them. Trying to figure out if any of them looked friendly enough for me to talk to. The people seemed fairly nice, but none of them looked like they would take their time to talk to the ""new girl"", let alone try to make friends with her. I was about to look behind me when the bell rang and the teacher stood up from his desk. He began to call roll, which gave me another opportunity to scrutinize @CAPS7 classmates. One by one he called everybody's name, making sure everybody was in their correct seats. Each name called was another new face for me. Still, nobody was quite catching @CAPS7 attention. Then he called out the name @PERSON1. I quickly scanned the room, trying to match a face to the name. Finally she replied ""here"", and I found her. Sitting in the desk diagonally behind me and to the right. She was casual. Wearing a hoodie from her youth group, a pair of jeans, and some tennis shoes. I knew right then, she was the one. She didn't just seem nice, but friendly as well. I quickly turned back to face the front of the classroom, delighted with @CAPS7 new discovery.  Homeroom was finally over and it was time to switch to out next class, @CAPS8. If I was going to strike up a conversation with @PERSON1, it was going to be now or never. I hastily walked up to her, trying to make it seem casual. I started to freak out, how was I going to start this? I decided on just a simple ""hi"". Thankfully, that was all it took. She turned to me with her imperfect smile, and said hello. We introduced each other and started talking about what we thought this new @CAPS5 was going to be like. We shared a few laughs over our teacher's thinning hair, and the few crazy stories he had already told us. She even invited me to sit by her in out next class. Throughout the course of the day, we slowly grew closer and opened up more. We spoke about our home lives. Laughed at immature jokes. We were getting in trouble for passing notes when we weren't supposed to, and even thinking about hanging out that weekend.

What was this, the seventh one? Yeah, that seemed about right. This time it was different, though. I wasn't just a little kid anymore with one classroom to sit in all day. Not only was it @CAPS7 first day at a new @CAPS5, it was @CAPS7 first day of @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Where you used binders instead of notebooks. Where you didn't sit in the same desk all day. Where you had a schedule that you had to memorize, and a locker combination as well. Where they only gave you four minutes to get to class on time. Plus, I was back at the bottom of the food chain, this time, with no friends. Nobody I could turn to in class to talk with. Nobody to share a laugh with at lunch. Not only did I not know anybody, I was a nobody. I scurried into @CAPS7 first class of the day, homeroom. For the first time, I was hoping there was a seating chart so that I didn't have to awkwardly choose @CAPS3 to sit by. Thankfully, @CAPS3 out there thought I deserved a break, and there was.

Waiting for the rest of @CAPS7 classmates to arrive, anxiously anticipating to find out who @CAPS7 neighbors would be. Finally, everybody was in class, and the bell rang. I glanced around the room. Taking everybody in. Judging them. Trying to figure out if any of them looked friendly enough for me to talk to. The people seemed fairly nice, but none of them looked like they would take their time to talk to the ""new girl"", let alone try to make friends with her. I was about to look behind me when the bell rang and the teacher stood up from his desk. He began to call roll, which gave me another opportunity to scrutinize @CAPS7 classmates. One by one he called everybody's name, making sure everybody was in their correct seats. Each name called was another new face for me. Still, nobody was quite catching @CAPS7 attention. Then he called out the name @PERSON1. I quickly scanned the room, trying to match a face to the name. Finally she replied ""here"", and I found her. Sitting in the desk diagonally behind me and to the right. She was casual. Wearing a hoodie from her youth group, a pair of jeans, and some tennis shoes. I knew right then, she was the one. She didn't just seem nice, but friendly as well. I quickly turned back to face the front of the classroom, delighted with @CAPS7 new discovery. Homeroom was finally over and it was time to switch to out next class, @CAPS8. If I was going to strike up a conversation with @PERSON1, it was going to be now or never. I hastily walked up to her, trying to make it seem casual. I started to freak out, how was I going to start this? I decided on just a simple ""hi"". Thankfully, that was all it took. She turned to me with her imperfect smile, and said hello. We introduced each other and started talking about what we thought this new @CAPS5 was going to be like. We shared a few laughs over our teacher's thinning hair, and the few crazy stories he had already told us. She even invited me to sit by her in out next class.

When you were a teenager you smiled at somethings, but no as much as you used to when you were a little kid. Now when your an adult and are independent you don't smile much. Because there is so much stress and worry over things. Just a simple smile can change things for most if not all of us.  People consider a smile just as a daily routine, but when you think about it a smile can change someones life. If everyone just went about their day without taking a break or hearing a little joke to make you smile, the stressful days would probably get even more stressful and maybe boring. When there has been a devastating event that occurred some place in the world and they show some kids who are so sad, hungry, crying, and lonely one thing that we would all want to do is make each and everyone of those kids smile. If there was a commercial advertising toys, food, or even games to those kids probably fifty percent of us would donate or buy them.

The fact that we can call me every morning and every night puts a smile on my face. @PERSON2 and I did meet @ORGANIZATION1 through my brother while playing a @CAPS1 called @ORGANIZATION1. Automatically I did hate him just because my first impression of him was everything negative. Every time we had to party up to level we ignored each other but if we did chat it was full of rude remarks, my favorite when he used to try and be mean to me was always ""@CAPS2 we should take the laptop out of the kitchen so @CAPS3 can focus on making me my sandwich @PERSON1.""

44,21689,8," My dad always says, ""Laughter is the best medicine."" I never really thought about it, as far as i was concerned it was just some old saying that had nothing to @CAPS4 with my life. Then one day, I realized that laughter was ,and is, truly the best medicine.  Last @DATE1 i was having a terrible time. Constantly worrying about my junior year and the college courses I would be taking. I was working five days a week for seven to eight hours a day. My job was irritating and stressful, making me constantly on the edge of a break down. I never had much time for hanging out with my friends or going to the lake like most fifteen year old's @CAPS4; @CAPS3 my weekends were spent catching up on sleep and babysitting for my parents. I never got to stop and just take a deep breath to calm myself and my nerves; i was on the go non stop.  One day, after a long day at work, i came home to find my house a complete and utter disaster. @CAPS3 of asking me how my day was or trying to talk to me and make me feel better, my mother says, ""@CAPS1! Why haven't you done the dishes?"" or ""@CAPS1! Why is the front room a disaster? Clean it now."" @CAPS3 of reasoning with her or trying to tell her about my day, I blow up! I tell her how I never get a break and how ""horrible"" my life is going; that I never, ever get one second for myself. How I am exhausted all the time and I can never @CAPS4 anything right. I say, ""@CAPS4 the dishes yourself."" I storm out. As I am walking out of the place I call home, all I can think of is how incredibly wrong my mother is. Does she not know how hard I work everyday? Does she not realize how much stress I have in my life? Of course not! How could she? Okay, yes she does work. Okay, yes she never has time to hang out with her friends either. And fine, she has to come home from a hard days work only to realize her house is destroyed and she is the one who has to clean it. That is when it dawned on me, I am a whiner! How can I be the one complaining when, hello, my mother has it just as bad as I @CAPS4, and @CAPS3 of talking to her about it, and trying to reason, guess what I @CAPS4? Yell at her then make a grand exit. How immature.  I go back inside and find my mother sitting on the couch reading her book. She looks up at me and gives me the I-know-how-you-feel look. I immediately start crying, letting all of my frustration and irritation out of my system. My mom gives me a hug and kisses my forehead. I then realize, how incredibly pointless this whole entire scene was, and start laughing hysterically, and my mother laughs with me.

At eight @CAPS1 we had packed five cars full of people and four ice coolers full of food to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and oh my gosh that day was so much fun, but it seemed like it took for ever but we kept our selves entertained @CAPS14 the way there. The night before my dad (@CAPS4) said that we are leaving at eight thirty @CAPS1 no matter what, and let me tell @CAPS9 when my dad says were leaving at a certain time we leave at that time and not a second later or we end up having to listen to him complain and yell about not leaving at the right time. Everyone went to bed early that night so we wouldn't have any problems in the morning getting up but of course I wake up to my little brother and my dad arguing because he doesn't want to get up and and he doesn't want to go, what a way to wake up for my birthday right? After all the fighting stopped my brother (little @CAPS4) got out of bed and got ready to go to the @CAPS3 and he helped put everything in the car. My dad decided he wanted to ride his motorcycle to the @CAPS3 so he called up some of his friends and said that he wanted to ride so they had to because he is the president of theFreebird motorcycle club and his @CAPS5 president said ""alright lets ride"" anyone in the club that was going had to ride there motorcycle or they had to pay @MONEY1 to the club because that is the club rule. At seven thirty all of my friends started showing up my dad didn't really understand @CAPS6 many people I had invited it was my sixteenth birthday I had to @CAPS10 a lot of people. He started getting frustrated and yelling saying ""@CAPS6 MANY @CAPS7 PEOPLE @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11!!!"" I said only like ten or eleven maybe twelve people its not that many dad. Well good thing for me only eight people showed up. I was sad but I was very happy that I didn't have to cram a bunch of people in our car and listen to my dad yell.

Half way threw the song we all started singing and then we all laughed so hard that by the time we got to the @CAPS3 we all had to pee. At ten @CAPS1 we arrived at the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 and they were a lot of people there. I was so excited because not a lot of my friends have been to the @CAPS3 and it amazing there.  When @CAPS9 first get to the @CAPS3 in the morning its not hot enough to get into the @CAPS2 yet so me and all of my friends sat in the sun soaking it all up so we would get hot enough to jump off the @CAPS2 fall, or @CAPS9 can slide.

46,21692,8," When I was younger i had a neighbor named @PERSON1. I didn't like her that much, she seemed a little stuck up to me. One day my mom made me go to a birthday party for her. I absolutely did not want to go! Somehow i ended up going. When we went she had gotten all of theses amazing gifts, I envied her at that moment. I started to get bored of partying thing so I went to explore the house. I know that snooping isn't a good thing but i was bored and ready to find some adventure in my day. I walked into a bedroom; nothing fun so i walked into another bedroom; empty. There was no adventure in this house i thought to myself. I finally entered the last bedroom. i walked in and saw a game cube. I had always wanted one so i decided to take a look at it; i looked at all of her games and found my favorite one, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So i put the game in and started to play.           After about fifteen minutes of playing a girl came in. It was @PERSON1.""@CAPS3 are you doing in my room?!"" she yelled "" oh I'm so sorry i was bored out there so i came in here to play @CAPS1 @CAPS2."" i replied ""oh well that's fine."" @PERSON1 said. I was almost in shock because she didn't deemed like she cared in fact she even said that she didn't care. She was one confusing girl. She sat on her bed and began to watch me play.""would you like to play?"" i asked n a gentle voice."" after all it is you game"" ""sure."" she replied. we started to play together. After a while of playing we decided to stop. Then we sat on her bed and started to talk about ourselves.  She loved to do everything i loved to do. We were two peas in a pod. I started to think to myself that i had got the wrong impression from her. turns out she is a nice girl who is cool to hang out with. Later that night my mom came in the room and told me it was time to go, but i didn't want to go because i was having so much fun! So @PERSON1 asked her mom if i could stay the night and she said yes; so i stayed the night with @PERSON1. We stayed up so late telling secrets, telling stories and getting to know each other better. She was starting to become my best friend.  Since she lived right next door to me it was really easy for me to go and see her after school and on the weekends. I would go over there all the time; her house become my second home. Even throughout the @DATE1 we hung out all the time. I would do camping with her and her family, she would go on hiking trips with mine, and we would even have our own little camping trips in our backyards. She was my best friend in the whole world. I love her with all my heart.  To this very day she is still my best friend, well more like my sister because everyday we just become more and more closer. Didn't think that was possible but it is. We both moved out of our house and into bigger houses. Sadly we don't live next to each other anymore, in fact we live on two opposite sides of the town; but someway somehow we always find a way to still hang out and share our laughs.

Laughter is the best medicine and opens your eyes, reveling new things, experiences, and people to come.","Laughter is considered the best medicine by most. It's know to build friendships and be a big hit at parties and gatherings ranging in sizes from big to small. It makes awkward moments and priceless moments remarkable memories. A true story with laughter isn't hard to come by for most. Laughter surrounds us daily. Most relationships are filled with laughter whether there friendships, family or more. I want it to be know that this isn't a love story theirs no real ending. Its the truth from my finger tips to your hands. It was a @DATE1. Do you know those moments where there are so many things you could be doing, but you just sit there for hours on end? Well this was that kind of day. I reached over the couches arm and grabbed my iPod, leaning back on the couch I swiped my finger across the lock bar. I was scrolling around the app store looking for some free new games. I came across and app called mini nation now don't laugh or mark me with straight zeros yet just keep reading. The description read, ""An exciting new app of over a million teen users, reading to mingle and interact."" I thought why not and clicked download. I was a bit skeptical and was wondering what people would act like. I requested to be friends with five dozen people or more. I read about who they where briefly and saw some posts and there animated self and photos they put up. Some where clearly outrageous and disturbing, you could pick and choose. The only thing I ever wrote in my description was, ""I'm on here to meet knew people I suppose... I'm here to ask you @CAPS2 your life story?"" @CAPS1 time I sent a request I'd delete the standard message and type, ""@CAPS2 your story? @CAPS2 made you into who you are today?"" I'd always change it up and make it different. I gained a lot of friends very quickly. Some people didn't understand the question I explained it to more hen a handful of people. My in box and wall would be full of people telling me there stories or requesting me. They all found what I was doing to be quite interesting. I asked this simple question because what better way to get to know someone? I've learned a lot of things about more then @NUM1 people, and no I'm not exaggerating. I @MONTH1 not remember everything or everyone. I can tell you a lot of people where grateful or relieved that someone wanted to hear there story, and I felt honored to hear them. Everyone's was different and so was @CAPS1 person. It opened my eyes to how different we all really are. What we've been trough, how we've been raised. told what to believe in or wear. How people found and outlet and how they got away from everyday stress we call life. I remember one guy in particular @PERSON1. His story was tragic at times, he hadn't been happy in a long time, but the first day we started talking he said I really made him smile a true smile. He just opened up to me which he said was very unusual. I would usually get someones story, they wouldn't ask for mine back and they'd say hi once in a while. With @CAPS3 I couldn't help but ask more questions something drew me in. We've been talking for quite a while now and it turned out he doesn't live that far away from me. We dropped mini nation and started to skype and text constantly. While we talked about tragic things like his brother passing away at eighteen because of a drunk driver crashing into his car on the freeway, we'd always find something to laugh about a while latter. We talked a lot and still do. something about him kept pulling me in and wanting to get to know him more. Our days of conversations where and are still filled with laughter.

When we made the shakes we were already jumping off the walls. @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 were laughing so hard they were already on the floor laughing before any sugar had got to their system. I started cracking up when ice cream started flying and ended up all over the kitchen. There was ice cream on the floor, the ceiling, on the dog, in the sink, it was everywhere. I was in tears when @ORGANIZATION1's golden blond hair was chocolate syrup pored on it. She was freaking out and no one would do anything but to laugh.  Our first batch of milk shakes went to the boys. They hated it. They told us it was to chocolaty. When we tried it, we didn't think it was chocolaty enough. That lead to a second batch of milk shakes. This time we mixed the chocolate ice cream and syrup with chocolate milk. When we blended everything together, it just seemed nearly perfect. The three browns made the most beautiful color of chocolate brown ever. It seems like it was made for heaven. While the milk shakes were being made, us girls were being adventures. We looked around the kitchen to find something else to put in our heavenly milk shakes. That is when @ORGANIZATION1 found the @CAPS1 @CAPS2.

49,21697,8," I walk out from behind the curtain and step out onto the dark stage. I adjust my suspenders, pop into character, look at my chalkboard and then the lights flash on. Before I can even move or utter a single word the audience roars into absolute hysterics. With every breathe, every step, and with every thought I could hear the audience erupt into a frenzy of hysterics. From beginning to end the audience continued to roar with laughter until the lights went down. Then all of a sudden it was quiet. The quietness left me as an actor in as much suspense as the audience was to meet for one @TIME1 @TIME1 up on the stage. My fellow cast members walked on one by one for curtain call. The suspense as well as the volume of the audience increased until it was @TIME1 for me to walk out onto the stage for the @TIME1, and then, it happened. The suspense I had felt finally just exploded from the crowd like a volcanic blast with each step I took toward them. With each step they grew louder and then, I stopped. The lights went down and as I had begun I was alone on the dark stage.  After the cheering had stopped I ran to meet my cast and my best of friends in the dressing rooms. The second I walked into the room I was greeted with hugs, kisses, and sheer joy. We tore our costumes off and threw on our everyday clothes and ran as fast as we could possibly run to the lobby of the auditorium because their we believed we would find some very congratulatory fans waiting for us.  To our surprise their was more than just a few people waiting for us. It felt like the entire city of @LOCATION1 had come to congratulate us on such a wonderful performance. I shook hands and talked to many people but in a corner of the lobby I noticed an old man standing their with his sobbing eyes staring at me. I at first was slightly creep-ed out by this man because he would not take his eyes off me and after what had felt like an hours worth of thanking people I decided to do the same with this old man. I walked up shook his hand and looked into his big sobbing eyes and thanked him for coming. Before I could pull away he collapsed into my arms and began to cry like a new born baby. After a minute of attempting to comfort the poor man he said, ""@CAPS1, thank you. You have a true gift my boy and that is to bring people laughter."" I smiled at him but I wasn't quite sure what he truly meant by this. It was then that I noticed the pink bandanna around his arm and my eyes widened. He gave me a warm smile and said, "" @CAPS2, my boy, I am what you think I am. A poor diseased old man. Now for me too end my life knowing that I got to see someone live out the dream I had once longed for is incredible. I wish you good luck in the future and I hope that someone will bring you as much laughter and joy as you have brought me."" I smiled, gave the old man a hug, and thanked him one @TIME1 @TIME1. When I began that day I thought that I was going to just get a few laughs and get a few congratulations but I never even dreamed of making a huge impact in someones life just by making them laugh.

I adjust my suspenders, pop into character, look at my chalkboard and then the lights flash on. Before I can even move or utter a single word the audience roars into absolute hysterics. With every breathe, every step, and with every thought I could hear the audience erupt into a frenzy of hysterics. From beginning to end the audience continued to roar with laughter until the lights went down. Then all of a sudden it was quiet. The quietness left me as an actor in as much suspense as the audience was to meet for one @TIME1 @TIME1 up on the stage. My fellow cast members walked on one by one for curtain call. The suspense as well as the volume of the audience increased until it was @TIME1 for me to walk out onto the stage for the @TIME1, and then, it happened. The suspense I had felt finally just exploded from the crowd like a volcanic blast with each step I took toward them. With each step they grew louder and then, I stopped. The lights went down and as I had begun I was alone on the dark stage. After the cheering had stopped I ran to meet my cast and my best of friends in the dressing rooms. The second I walked into the room I was greeted with hugs, kisses, and sheer joy. We tore our costumes off and threw on our everyday clothes and ran as fast as we could possibly run to the lobby of the auditorium because their we believed we would find some very congratulatory fans waiting for us. To our surprise their was more than just a few people waiting for us. It felt like the entire city of @LOCATION1 had come to congratulate us on such a wonderful performance. I shook hands and talked to many people but in a corner of the lobby I noticed an old man standing their with his sobbing eyes staring at me. I at first was slightly creep-ed out by this man because he would not take his eyes off me and after what had felt like an hours worth of thanking people I decided to do the same with this old man. I walked up shook his hand and looked into his big sobbing eyes and thanked him for coming. Before I could pull away he collapsed into my arms and began to cry like a new born baby. After a minute of attempting to comfort the poor man he said, ""@CAPS1, thank you. You have a true gift my boy and that is to bring people laughter."" I smiled at him but I wasn't quite sure what he truly meant by this. It was then that I noticed the pink bandanna around his arm and my eyes widened. He gave me a warm smile and said, "" @CAPS2, my boy, I am what you think I am. A poor diseased old man. Now for me too end my life knowing that I got to see someone live out the dream I had once longed for is incredible. I wish you good luck in the future and I hope that someone will bring you as much laughter and joy as you have brought me."" I smiled, gave the old man a hug, and thanked him one @TIME1 @TIME1. When I began that day I thought that I was going to just get a few laughs and get a few congratulations but I never even dreamed of making a huge impact in someones life just by making them laugh.

52,21700,8," When I was younger there was a lot that would make anyone laugh. Many times my family in @LOCATION3 would come visit us in @LOCATION1. One specific time, we all decided to travel to @ORGANIZATION2, which would be mine and my younger sister by two years' first time going. So we all waited for my great-grandparents to come and pick my parents, uncles, grandma, sister and I to pick us up in their tiny @CAPS1. My great-grandparents decided to bring a few extra people, including my great aunt and @CAPS3, their @NUM1 year-old son and their @NUM2 year old son. By the time we were all packed into the @CAPS1 there was hardly any space to move. The trip from our home in @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 was a little over @NUM3 @DATE1. For a child my age, it wasn't the best thing in the @ORGANIZATION2, and for my younger sister and cousin, it was even worse. My great-grandma decided to give all the kids some candy, by the time it was finished, we were all sticky and had red sticky faces. My @CAPS3 @PERSON2, who was in his sophmore year of high school, helped clean us all up. The car ride was long and boring, by the time we had gotten there it was past midnight. My great-aunt and her husband and son, decided to get a cabin in the middle of nowhere, where my family, uncles, and grandma, stayed in a simple hotel. My great-grandparents, parked their @CAPS1 in the @ORGANIZATION2 parking lot. The next morning, we all met up at @ORGANIZATION2, my great-aunt told us her story about out at the cabin, her bed was filled with moths, not a very fun @TIME1 for them. We all entered the park and split up. If I'm not mistaken, we were at @ORGANIZATION3, where the have the @CAPS5 show. By @TIME1, we all gathered for the show and sat and watched it. In the middle of the show, it began pouring rain. We all went back to the @CAPS1, everyone completely soaked, good thing it was @DATE3 or we would have freezed. Once in the @CAPS1, my great-grandma gave us all towels to dry off with and began laughing at us. She then drove us back to our hotel and we dried off, by that time, the ran had stopped.  Once we were all dry, my uncles decided to go swimming, and it was getting pretty late. We all went to the pool and played around for awhile, when we got back, we were just as wet as we had been @DATE1. We all dried off and got ready for bed. My sister and I laid in the bed we had to share, my parents in the bed beside us. It didn't take long for the two year-old to fall asllep. When she sleeps, she takes up a lot of room, so sharing the bed with a two year-old baby, I only got a corner of the bed. She still sleeps the same way.  On the way back to a different park that morning, the entire way, my dad kept saying, ""I'm ready, are you ready?"" and we would say it back and forth between each other, which had my little sister laughing. Once at the park, we all went on some rides, including The @CAPS8 @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS11, which turned out to be my @CAPS3's favorite ride even though he got wet. We met many different characters, @PERSON1, stuck out in my mind because she tried to keep my dad as we began leaving. As it got later, we went to a couple more rides then got ready for the @ORGANIZATION1, which to this @DATE2 is my favorite @ORGANIZATION1, then we saw the firework show. By the @DATE2, we were all work out and ready to go to bed.

I was only a little @NUM2 year old and @PERSON1 was a very stern lass who never ran out of rude things to say. So I gathered my information and weighed my pros and cons, instead of deciding to be rude and hurtful back to @PERSON1 I decided to kill her with kindness just as my grandma had taught me to do. I knew it would take a lot and I was ready to take on this challenge.It was the @DATE2 after a long @DATE1 and I was just ready for @PERSON1 to try and break my friend @PERSON2 down just a little bit more.

Now don't get me wrong @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have known just how to irritate @PERSON1 and push her buttons but @PERSON2 is only @NUM2, not trying to make any excuses for her but screaming at her and singling her out in the class room was in my opinion the wrong way to approach or teach @PERSON2 whatever lesson she was trying to tech her. I mean @PERSON2 is only human, and a habit isn't easy to kick even if your only @NUM2 years-old. @PERSON2 wasn't the type of kid to purposely aggravate someone intentionally. You could say it just kind of happened. I could also see where @PERSON1 was coming from also, she didn't want fingernails everywhere but I won't let this rest she was really rude on how she went about it. Since @PERSON2 was such a nice person I decided to take action. @PERSON2 and I sat across the table group and I could tell she was a little discouraged I just started talking to her and that cheered her up a little bit but then I knew it was time for plan b, jokes. I started telling her chicken jokes, she just began to laugh.

We thought it was the funniest thing ever. Days turned into weeks and weeks led to months and as soon as we knew it, it was @DATE3 and school was getting let out. We made a promise the last day of school to never forget our year together, and to still call one another @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 seed. We held that promise and to this day we are still very close and occasionally run into @PERSON1 at our small-town local store and just laugh but that year I learned more than just how do do multiplication or how to read over a thousand pages in a book all of that could have been taken away all that matters about that year was making friends with @PERSON2 and truly learning that laughter is the essence of life and that means more to me than anything else my fourth grade year.

My best friend @PERSON1 came to watch, @CAPS3 so did my mom and sister.

It was our turn. @CAPS3 our band walked up onto the stage, I was looking for my mom, sister, and @LOCATION1. I found all three of them sitting right next to each other. I smiled. They smiled back.

A life without laughter, would be like having no life at all.","Getting @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Laughter @CAPS3 they say, "" Laughter adds on more years to your life"". It's what makes things more enjoyable. I've had so many moments in which laughter was involved. Let me share one of those times... It all started on the day of my band concert. My best friend @PERSON1 came to watch, @CAPS3 so did my mom and sister. I was in the band room warming up @CAPS2 the rest of the band while the stage room filled up @CAPS2 about one hundred people.An hour went by. It was our turn. @CAPS3 our band walked up onto the stage, I was looking for my mom, sister, and @LOCATION1. I found all three of them sitting right next to each other. I smiled. They smiled back. About an hour later, our concert was over. @CAPS3 the stage room was emptying out, the band were taking the chairs and stands back to the band room. I found my mom and sister and we went out to find our car. When we started driving @CAPS1, I noticed @PERSON1 running behind us. My mom and I started laughing. When we came near the exit out of the school parking lot, my mom stopped and rolled down the window. @PERSON1 walked up to our car and yelled, "" I love you @PERSON2!"" That's my mom's name. Finally after about five minutes of talking and not letting us leave, we headed over down the road to a fast food place; leaving @PERSON1 behind at the school. While my mom was ordering, I heard this screaming. It sounded like an @CAPS4 call. I looked my head out the window and there was @PERSON1 hanging her head out the window of my other friend, @PERSON3's, car, screaming at my mom and I. My mom and I just burst out laughing. About five minutes later, we were done ordering. We knew @PERSON1 was waiting around the corner for us, so my mom decided to go the opposite direction to play a trick on her. Just @CAPS3 we thought, there we seen @PERSON1 running towards @PERSON3's car. She had noticed that we didn't come her way. After my mom, my sister, and I, got on the highway towards our house, I had gotten a text message on my phone from @LOCATION1 saying she was going to follow us on the highway to our house. I told my mom what she said and we all just laughed. Laughter; the best medicine in life. If it wasn't for my friends, family, and the little enjoyable things in life, my life would be boring. My story was a true life experience in which my best friend pumped up her crazy side and did some funny things to make us laugh.

55,21704,8," Laughter's reason of element  @CAPS1 exception there are many reasons why laughter is very important, but this is my reason why laughter is considered its own element for more than one way. Laughter is used in many results, as when you respond to someone's activates or ideas. Another way why laughter is it's own element is when people or yourself are in a bad situation, you always want to look on the bright side of things. Laughter is many small examples that are describing its self in one element. Laughter to me is very important especially at a time in need. For example my family is going through tough times right now for the reason that my oldest sister might have cancer. I am always looking for ways to make her laugh. To me her laugh is the most important to me because it's my job to keep her with hope and to at least keep her happy. I know when we get through this I will always have laughter with me and will use it in many different ways. I have never thought I would be using laughter at this kind of time and hopefully I never have to again. Eventually laughter is used is in relationships. I agree that laughter is an important part in a relation ship because that is all my family have in theirs. My oldest brother has had one relationship his hole entire life and has kept it going my using laughter to his advantage. The funny part in this is that him and his wife make fun of everything from each other to everything around them including their daughters. Laughter to them is the most important part of their relationship. To me every relationship should have laughter and I'm glad that everybody has that element to express. Using laughter in a relationship must be cautious because not in every situation can you or want to use it. Laughter in a relationship can be the best or the worst depending in the timing.  Finally laughter is used in many ways like bullying or joking and laughter fits in all of these categories. When someone laughs at somebodies offensive jokes toward somebody else they are going to continue to keep picking on that person or others. In this generation there is not much bullying, but when there is it gets serious and some times out of hand. Our generation doesn't know how to handle a bad comment, so we take it like a threat. Laughing in those situations aren't good they cause trouble. There is a difference between laughing to jokes and laughing to bad comments. In jokes when you laugh don't hurt any one, but they do give the person who says it confidence. I love it when people laugh at my jokes because it makes my self-e-steam way higher. @CAPS1 making people happy you don't get laughter, and happiness is what gives laughter its it's way of use. Therefore, if laughter is considered an element just for one reason, I think its wrong because there are limitless reasons why it's considered an element. I also hope these reasons help explain why laughter is considered an element for more than one way. Laughter is and will always be needed for everyone.

Laughter is something that will always bring people together. Without it, life would be boring, uninteresting and nothing would be the same. Laughter is how I met most of the people I am friends with today, including my best friend. It was probably, a month into sixth grade. Maybe even longer. I walked into @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I didn't really like @CAPS15 class. It was boring and I never really talked to anyone, just sat there silently listening to what the teacher had to say. @CAPS8 went on about @CAPS15 project we had to do. @CAPS8 held up poster after poster, explaining every detail and what her expectations were. I liked @PERSON1, @CAPS8 made everything easy to understand and I was never confused on anything @CAPS8 explained. The task was to chose a topic that had something to do with ancient @LOCATION1, and then create a poster and be ready to present it to the class by next week. I thought about it for a while. I hated doing speeches. I didn't want to get in front of the class at all, but I didn't really have any other choice. I decided I was going to make mine about @CAPS6. I heard a lot about her, @CAPS19 I figured that @CAPS15 speech was going to be pretty easy. The bell rang loudly, drawing me out of my thoughts. It wasn't the bell that told us that our next class was starting, it was the bell that rang when we had a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 break. I sighed and sat back down at my desk, while almost everyone else, bolted out the door to talk to their friends. I thought the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 break was a waste of time. What was there to do in @CAPS1 minutes? Nothing. I sat there, taking out a piece of paper and a pen, and started drawing. Rather than talk to people I didn't know, I always chose to sit at my desk and draw. I drew random things and often wrote lyrics to songs that were stuck in my head, waiting for those @CAPS1 minutes to pass. The paper I had, was from over the past couple weeks @CAPS19 it was chalk full of random drawings. I continued doodling on the paper, until I heard a loud smacking noise. I frowned and turned around, to see who or what had made the noise. When I looked behind me I saw someone moving @PERSON4's, the person who usually sat behind me, backpack, binder and books to another desk. The loud noise I had heard was her books smacking onto the desk, a row over from where @CAPS8 usually sat. I was confused not only because I wasn't sure what @CAPS15 person was doing, but also because I didn't recognize her at all. ""@CAPS7!"" @CAPS8 said in a very friendly tone, sitting in @PERSON4's seat. I frowned and waved anyways, ""@CAPS9..."" I wasn't really good with meeting new people, especially ones I have never seen before. I glanced at the clock, and realized that we only had a few more minutes until class resumed. ""@CAPS10 do know that someone else sits there, @CAPS12?"" I asked. @CAPS8 nodded, ""@CAPS11, I know."" @CAPS12 after @CAPS8 responded, @PERSON4 walked back into the class. @PERSON4 was nice, but I didn't really like her. @CAPS8 talked way to much and half of what @CAPS8 was saying I didn't pay attention to. Overall, I guess I kind of felt bad for her. @PERSON4 stood there staring at the desk, where her things once were laying. @CAPS8 looked confused, but very frustrated, ""That's my seat."" @CAPS8 said. The person who sat in her seat responded with, ""@CAPS14 it's not."" @CAPS15 made me laugh a little. ""@CAPS16 it it."" @PERSON4 said, raising her voice. The person shook her head, ""@CAPS14, your stuff is @CAPS12 there."" @CAPS8 pointed to a totally different desk. @PERSON4 sighed in frustration, but gave up and sat at her new seat.  Both of us started laughing. ""@CAPS19 what's your name?"" The stranger asked me. ""I'm @PERSON3, what's yours?"" I asked. @CAPS8 laughed, ""I'm @PERSON2.""We sat there talking about what we were going to do our projects on, and discovered that both of us, were doing it on @CAPS6. The rest of the class went by pretty fast. Well, faster than usual. @PERSON2 and I just sat there laughing and making jokes the majority of the class period, which made the class @CAPS19 much better than it usually would have been. Ever since that day @PERSON2 and I have been best friends, even now. I find it weird that now, when we haven't seen each other in a really long time all we do is laugh. @CAPS15 story is why I believe that the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" is true, because without laughter I don't think a lot of us would have the friends that we have now.

Overall, I guess I kind of felt bad for her. @PERSON4 stood there staring at the desk, where her things once were laying. @CAPS8 looked confused, but very frustrated, ""That's my seat."" @CAPS8 said. The person who sat in her seat responded with, ""@CAPS14 it's not."" @CAPS15 made me laugh a little. ""@CAPS16 it it."" @PERSON4 said, raising her voice. The person shook her head, ""@CAPS14, your stuff is @CAPS12 there."" @CAPS8 pointed to a totally different desk. @PERSON4 sighed in frustration, but gave up and sat at her new seat. Both of us started laughing. ""@CAPS19 what's your name?"" The stranger asked me. ""I'm @PERSON3, what's yours?"" I asked. @CAPS8 laughed, ""I'm @PERSON2.""We sat there talking about what we were going to do our projects on, and discovered that both of us, were doing it on @CAPS6. The rest of the class went by pretty fast. Well, faster than usual. @PERSON2 and I just sat there laughing and making jokes the majority of the class period, which made the class @CAPS19 much better than it usually would have been. Ever since that day @PERSON2 and I have been best friends, even now. I find it weird that now, when we haven't seen each other in a really long time all we do is laugh. @CAPS15 story is why I believe that the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" is true, because without laughter I don't think a lot of us would have the friends that we have now. Without laughter @CAPS15 place would be really, really boring.","The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 believe that the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" is true. Laughter is something that will always bring people together. Without it, life would be boring, uninteresting and nothing would be the same. Laughter is how I met most of the people I am friends with today, including my best friend. It was probably, a month into sixth grade. Maybe even longer. I walked into @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I didn't really like @CAPS15 class. It was boring and I never really talked to anyone, just sat there silently listening to what the teacher had to say. @CAPS8 went on about @CAPS15 project we had to do. @CAPS8 held up poster after poster, explaining every detail and what her expectations were. I liked @PERSON1, @CAPS8 made everything easy to understand and I was never confused on anything @CAPS8 explained. The task was to chose a topic that had something to do with ancient @LOCATION1, and then create a poster and be ready to present it to the class by next week. I thought about it for a while. I hated doing speeches. I didn't want to get in front of the class at all, but I didn't really have any other choice. I decided I was going to make mine about @CAPS6. I heard a lot about her, @CAPS19 I figured that @CAPS15 speech was going to be pretty easy. The bell rang loudly, drawing me out of my thoughts. It wasn't the bell that told us that our next class was starting, it was the bell that rang when we had a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 break. I sighed and sat back down at my desk, while almost everyone else, bolted out the door to talk to their friends. I thought the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 break was a waste of time. What was there to do in @CAPS1 minutes? Nothing. I sat there, taking out a piece of paper and a pen, and started drawing. Rather than talk to people I didn't know, I always chose to sit at my desk and draw. I drew random things and often wrote lyrics to songs that were stuck in my head, waiting for those @CAPS1 minutes to pass. The paper I had, was from over the past couple weeks @CAPS19 it was chalk full of random drawings. I continued doodling on the paper, until I heard a loud smacking noise. I frowned and turned around, to see who or what had made the noise. When I looked behind me I saw someone moving @PERSON4's, the person who usually sat behind me, backpack, binder and books to another desk. The loud noise I had heard was her books smacking onto the desk, a row over from where @CAPS8 usually sat. I was confused not only because I wasn't sure what @CAPS15 person was doing, but also because I didn't recognize her at all. ""@CAPS7!"" @CAPS8 said in a very friendly tone, sitting in @PERSON4's seat. I frowned and waved anyways, ""@CAPS9..."" I wasn't really good with meeting new people, especially ones I have never seen before. I glanced at the clock, and realized that we only had a few more minutes until class resumed. ""@CAPS10 do know that someone else sits there, @CAPS12?"" I asked. @CAPS8 nodded, ""@CAPS11, I know."" @CAPS12 after @CAPS8 responded, @PERSON4 walked back into the class. @PERSON4 was nice, but I didn't really like her. @CAPS8 talked way to much and half of what @CAPS8 was saying I didn't pay attention to.

57,21707,8," ""@CAPS1 in the @CAPS2.""  The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 look back on an event in someone's life; more emotions build on that one thought of the past then they do in the @CAPS2 of the event itself. A few weeks earlier was my @CAPS2. I awoke at approximately five forty in the morning excited to go to our wrestling tournament at @LOCATION1 ridge @ORGANIZATION1. I had placed fifth at @CAPS6 tournament the previous year, and couldn't wait to get the day started. When we met at the @ORGANIZATION1 I had already built myself a bad start @CAPS5 being exactly one pound over the weight I had to wrestle. The drive only lasted an hour, and I knew our scale was heavy. It still worried me. Upon arrival both a fellow teammate and I had to go cut weight. We ran together for just over a half hour. Each of us made it with ease. Me weighing nearly two pounds under. As a team, we relaxed and waited for more schools to show up. We ate and watched the other wrestlers begin their warm ups. Something about that morning didn't feel right, my bones were aching and my muscles felt a little tender from cutting weight just a little bit earlier. My warm up was sloppy and slow. It grew harder to want to move after each drill we did. It ended with a few short sprints, and @CAPS4 went extra slow as well. The mats got cleared, and shortly after that, matches began. A lot of our guys won their first match, and it got to me fast. At first when I saw the kid I had to wrestle, I thought I was lucky. The previous year I pinned the two guys ahead of him in their varsity line ups. One thing I couldn't get my mind of though, he looked strong. The match just before ours ended quickly, and I felt very tense, like I wasn't ready. Our hands shook and the whistle blew. His collar tie was weak ""it shouldn't be long before a good shot opens."" I thought to myself. I was wrong. When the @CAPS2 came I took the shot and got @CAPS1 in a bulldog, and it was becoming nearly impossible to breathe.That's it, my last vivid scene from the match was me trying to do an arm drag to get out of his bulldog. All I remember beyond that point was seeing some color changes in my mind. I awoke to coach and a few other people over me and it took me a @CAPS2 to realize what had happened. Coach looked at me, smiled and said "" @CAPS3 pissed yourself @PERSON2."" @CAPS4 words taunted me in the back of my mind repeatedly that day. My body went into a complete shut down mode while I was knocked out. A few of my team mates told me that my legs shook like I was going into shock. I relaxed the rest of that day just because it was a little disheartening, @CAPS5 the time @DATE1 came, I was back ready to go again.  @CAPS6 team is my family together we drive our bodies to the limit everyday, only to go home sleep, and do it all over again. The guys didn't mention what happened to me other then to answer my questions or to see how I was doing despite my little event. Most people would be embarrassed @CAPS5 an experience like that, but thanks to the support of my team when it happened, I wrestle just that much more cautiously, meaner, and stronger. Every week there is at least one day where everyone feels great. We are working hard and enjoying it in the process. We love cracking jokes and goofing around. So me and senior captain @PERSON1 always play around with the thought of what happened to me. Sometimes he will get a head lock and I start making my legs twitch like I was told they did, and we both get a good laugh from it. Other times we talk about how it felt to be knocked out. To be honest it wasn't bad all that bad either. It felt like I just woke from a nap, and was well rested, even though I was only out for a minute or so. It is my @CAPS2, and it was both embarrassing and scary when it happened. Now it is one of the funniest stories I have to tell from wrestling. Most people, I guarantee, have not been to as many places as I , or have had as many experiences as me either. Out of all of them, @CAPS6 will probably be one I remember for a while because it is one of @CAPS4 moments where in the @CAPS2 it is scary, but the hindsight it is funny. Plus I enjoy @CAPS4 moments with my team when we can laugh about the little things and grow a stronger bond because of it.

It wasn't very hard for me to start a conversation with people but except people that were on a higher social status then me. Finally it was my group that the teacher was yelling out and so far I knew the name's of the people she was calling. Until she clearly read out the last name from the my group and I started to panic.

Talking to her was not a idea I had ever considered because students worshiped her, unlike me.

Surprisingly the cabin was supposed to be for a group of girls to share the tiny space and sleep in. As I unpacked my own things many of the girls began to talk to me about the trip. Would the other girl and I both get the curiosity to talk to each other? She actually did step toward me and began to have a real one word ""conversation"" with me. When the fun activities finally ended, we were sent off to go to sleep. Sure like a cabin filled with girls was really going to be able to go straight to sleep and sleep all night. Right when the cabin door closed, the noise and giggles began, including mine. The girls that had never talked to me started to to tell a scary story to scare everyone. She got up and said she had to go to the restroom and I had to go with her. We briskly walked to the bathroom without saying a word. I waited for her until she was finish and we started to walk back to the cabin. Until the silence was broken with a eerie sound that was made behind us. Both of us ran, screaming even laughing to the cabin. Confused, asked her why she was laughing and she responded that we were silly for being scared. Amazed that she was talking to me, I agreed with her, laughed a lot and by the end we were close friends. Laughter can force you see the bright side of people instead of the negative. Its an element that you can give or receive from others, but never take away. If you ever have the chance to make someone laugh, go and do it. Not only can it bring endless joy, but it can also impact a time period in your life.

The firework had gone off as planned and @PERSON1 looked very frightened, @CAPS1 family had woken up and came in to see what was going. They found me behind the couch dieing of laughter. I had to clean all cereal up as was expected.After everything had been said and done with we all laughed about @CAPS1 awsome prank, and @CAPS1 family and I left on our trip to @LOCATION2. This paticular story @MONTH1 @CAPS2 have some @ORGANIZATION1 meaning or symbol, but I decided to write about it because it made me laugh and I hope whoever is reading it laughs too. (@CAPS5.S- for those of you who think this story is to great to have actually happened I would like to gaurantee that it is indeed true and like all true stories has been slightly edited to be more intresting and more importantly to make me look good.) @CAPS6","Laughter @CAPS1 family is full of jokers. We are always teasing each other (in a good way) and cracking jokes (which @PERCENT1 of the time are actually funny). The fact that @CAPS1 family is so ""hilarious"" made the @NUM1 hour drive to @LOCATION1 slightly more bare able. @CAPS1 family is a grumpy family, always for the first hour or two of the day. @CAPS1 dad is grumpy if he does @CAPS2 get his food, @CAPS1 mom if she does @CAPS2 drink her coffee, @CAPS1 brother if he does @CAPS2 get his sleep, and @CAPS1 sister for the sake of being grumpy. I however am almost never grumpy so our trip had some conflicting ""interests"". We had begun our trip to @LOCATION2 by waking up at @TIME1, everyone got ready @CAPS1 dad ate, @CAPS1 mom drank her coffee, @CAPS1 brother napped, and I ignored @CAPS1 sister. After all of this we finally left at @TIME2, which began the next phase of our trip which was to drive for @NUM2 hours with as few bathroom breaks as possible until we reached @CAPS1 dad's friend's house. The @NUM2 hours did @CAPS2 fly by like I had hoped mainly because @CAPS1 family was @CAPS2 as talkative as I predicted and music on the radio is only interesting for so long, but none the less we finely made it to @CAPS1 dad's friend's house. From this point on in @CAPS1 story I will no longer refer to ""@CAPS1 dad's friend"" as ""@CAPS1 dad's friend, but I shall refer to him simply as @PERSON1. The reason I decided to do this is because this is his actual name and I assume that the reader is as lazy as me and does @CAPS2 want to constantly read ""@CAPS1 dad's friend"" no more than I want to write it, so for now on his name is @PERSON1. @PERSON1's house is frequently used free hotel/pitstop that @CAPS1 family uses whenever we head in ""@PERSON1's"" direction. The reason for this is that it allows @CAPS1 dad to visit with a friend he only see's a couple of times a year and it saves money that would otherwise be spent on some random hotel. Through the many times which I have spent the night at @PERSON1's house I eventually learned that the only way for me to keep myself entertained was to plot and then execute a prank upon our host (also known as @PERSON1). I had eventually decided to use a tripwire at the entrance of his kitchen to set off a small but @CAPS2 too small firework in a nearby @CAPS3 cereal box, causing it to explode(you would be surprised what you can learn from old @ORGANIZATION1) and effectively scaring @PERSON1 and causing a small mess which I would inevitably have to clean up but it was worth it. The next morning I got up about @NUM4 minutes before everyone so I could very quickly set everything up. I got it all done in about @NUM2 minutes and then went off to hide in the living room behind a couch in which I could still see the entrance to the kitchen. I waited about @NUM6 minutes until I finally heard @PERSON1 grumble, wake up, and shuffle down the hall. He was now just about to enter the kitchen aaannnnd @CAPS4!!!

62,21717,8," This friend was really like @CAPS21 soul mate sister. Have you ever felt a connection like that with your friend? Where everything you do is absolutely a blast, even if all you did all day was stalk cute boys on @CAPS1, and eat @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 all day long? Or, when you have a bad day, and don't want to talk about @CAPS11, that friend can place their finger on exactly what happened and if not exactly, pretty dang close? I'd never had a friend like that. Until @CAPS21 sophomore year.  Her name was @PERSON1, and @CAPS9 was new to @CAPS21 @ORGANIZATION1. I've always been the quiet, easily intimidated type, so I stayed away. Until about two weeks into the new @ORGANIZATION1 year that is. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS6 right?"" @PERSON1 said as @CAPS9 leaned @CAPS21 way. @CAPS9 was only about five lockers down from me. Funny, I hadn't even noticed that before. ""@CAPS7, that's me. What's @CAPS18?"" I said. Wondering what @CAPS9 needed and why @CAPS9 came to me of all people. I'm definitely not the 'coolest' student out there might I say. @CAPS9 looked so stuck @CAPS18, and too good for our @ORGANIZATION1, in the middle of no where. ""@CAPS8, I know this makes me sound like a loser, but I can't get @CAPS21 lock to open."" @CAPS9 mentioned, looking sort of embarrassed and desperate.  ""@CAPS10, no problem! What's your combo?"" I said, trying to sound nice, and easy to talk to. Maybe @CAPS9 isn't what I thought, I could always use a friend, I thought as I walked over to her locker.  ""@CAPS11's @NUM1. @CAPS11's a really crappy lock. @CAPS11 sticks for me. Maybe I just haven't got this whole lock thing down yet. In @LOCATION2, where I moved from, we didn't have lockers. I guess our @ORGANIZATION1 was too cheap or something."" @CAPS9 said, laughing at her comment and watching me fidget with her lock.  After around @NUM2 tries on the lock, and both of us laughing super hard about @CAPS11's difficulty, @CAPS11 finally popped open. Then, we just went our separate ways. But for the rest of the day, I kept wondering about her. That day went by, and then the week went by. I was still wondering about the new girl, @PERSON1. Where did @CAPS9 go for lunch? Did @CAPS9 already have a bunch of friends? Maybe I should just come out of @CAPS21 little shy girl shell and invite her to sit with me at lunch. But for some reason I just couldn't do @CAPS11. I'd get so close, and then, turn around out of fear of getting rejected. One day though, @CAPS9 came @CAPS18 to our table and asked to sit down. @CAPS9 had brought a full container of brownies to share, and wasn't hard to talk to at all. I was really excited. I couldn't help but have all these little fantasies about how me and her would be best friends forever, and dream about having sleepovers, and eating junk food and talking about he boys that we liked.  That @TIME1, I got on the computer and went on to @CAPS1, and sent her a friend request. @CAPS9 accepted! @CAPS9 was online at that same time, so I got @CAPS18 the guts, and sent her an instant message. ""I take @CAPS11, you haven't got any crazy plans for a @DATE2 @TIME1 either?"" I typed. ""@CAPS14. No of course not. The new girl has no friends, and does the same thing every weekend- sits at home, plays @CAPS15 with her little brother, and watches @CAPS16. What a life! How about you?"" ""@CAPS10 just about the same. No plans for tonight, or any other @TIME1. Ever. Where do you live?"" ""@CAPS18 the @LOCATION1. Basically the middle of no where.""  ""@CAPS19 hang out tonight? I can pick you @CAPS18, and you can stay the @TIME1?"" ""@CAPS20. Here's @CAPS21 # @NUM3. Call me when you leave and I'll give you @CAPS21 address."" @CAPS21 mom and I went and picked her @CAPS18 an hour later. After @NUM4 hours of being together, we had already hit @CAPS11 off. I could tell we would really become close friends. That @TIME1, we went out and hung out with boys we had never even talked to before! I guess we get more courageous around each other. We came home past curfew, and pulled an all @TIME1-er in @CAPS21 bedroom. Laughing all @TIME1 about the past events, and talking about what boys we think are cute, and what our families are like. That @TIME1 was the beginning of something special for me. I don't know if @PERSON1 knows that, but that friendship meant so much to me. I achieved the best friend I could ever ask for because of @PERSON1 asking me to open her locker and we laughed together. Something about laughing with someone, really connects people. Maybe because @CAPS11 makes them realize that those people are fun to be around? I'm not @CAPS20, but I just thank @CAPS22 every day that he gave me that one day in @DATE1 when @PERSON1 couldn't open her locker.",24717,39,80,1113,4681,3.461814915,13.9125, this friend was really like soul mate sister  have you ever felt a connection like that with your friend  where everything you do is absolutely a blast  even if all you did all day was stalk cute boys on and eat all day long  or  when you have a bad day  and don t want to talk about that friend can place their finger on exactly what happened and if not exactly  pretty dang close  i d never had a friend like that  until sophomore year   her name was and was new to i ve always been the quiet  easily intimidated type  so i stayed away  until about two weeks into the new year that is    caps  right   said as leaned way  was only about five lockers down from me  funny  i hadn t even noticed that before    caps  that s me  what s i said  wondering what needed and why came to me of all people  i m definitely not the  coolest  student out there might i say  looked so stuck and too good for our in the middle of no where    caps  i know this makes me sound like a loser  but i can t get lock to open   mentioned  looking sort of embarrassed and desperate     caps  no problem  what s your combo   i said  trying to sound nice  and easy to talk to  maybe isn t what i thought  i could always use a friend  i thought as i walked over to her locker     caps s a really crappy lock  sticks for me  maybe i just haven t got this whole lock thing down yet  in where i moved from  we didn t have lockers  i guess our was too cheap or something   said  laughing at her comment and watching me fidget with her lock   after around tries on the lock  and both of us laughing super hard about difficulty  finally popped open  then  we just went our separate ways  but for the rest of the day  i kept wondering about her  that day went by  and then the week went by  i was still wondering about the new girl  where did go for lunch  did already have a bunch of friends  maybe i should just come out of little shy girl shell and invite her to sit with me at lunch  but for some reason i just couldn t do i d get so close  and then  turn around out of fear of getting rejected  one day though  came to our table and asked to sit down  had brought a full container of brownies to share  and wasn t hard to talk to at all  i was really excited  i couldn t help but have all these little fantasies about how me and her would be best friends forever  and dream about having sleepovers  and eating junk food and talking about he boys that we liked   that i got on the computer and went on to and sent her a friend request  accepted  was online at that same time  so i got the guts  and sent her an instant message   i take you haven t got any crazy plans for a either   i typed    caps  no of course not  the new girl has no friends  and does the same thing every weekend  sits at home  plays with her little brother  and watches what a life  how about you     caps just about the same  no plans for tonight  or any other ever  where do you live     caps the basically the middle of no where      caps hang out tonight  i can pick you and you can stay the   caps  here s   call me when you leave and i ll give you address   mom and i went and picked her an hour later  after hours of being together  we had already hit off  i could tell we would really become close friends  that we went out and hung out with boys we had never even talked to before  i guess we get more courageous around each other  we came home past curfew  and pulled an all in bedroom  laughing all about the past events  and talking about what boys we think are cute  and what our families are like  that was the beginning of something special for me  i don t know if knows that  but that friendship meant so much to me  i achieved the best friend i could ever ask for because of asking me to open her locker and we laughed together  something about laughing with someone  really connects people  maybe because makes them realize that those people are fun to be around  i m not but i just thank every day that he gave me that one day in when couldn t open her locker ,946,81,133,115,47,43,74,124,14,"This friend was really like @CAPS21 soul mate sister.

66,21722,8," Laughter, it can be from a comedy movie or a good joke you just heard in the hallway. ""Laughter is the best medicine,"" it rings true so dearly to @CAPS4 sister any I. @CAPS4 sister goes through many doctors and many types of pains because of her disease. The way I help her get through it all is by watching some comedy movie or comedy televison show. One day, she was feeling terrible, and the one movie that I knew would help her wasThe @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She loves that movie because, she loves both of the starring actors, the comedy in it is rolling on the floor laughter, and she needed that little push of the romance that comes into the movie. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2; they are both amazing in their own ways, but in this particular movie it was terribly needed by @CAPS4 sister. These two actors' chemistry between each other helped so much with @CAPS4 sister. @CAPS4 sister, @PERSON3, stopped complaining about her terrible pain just five minutes into the movie! She asked me for popcorn, and to bring her a soda, I was happy to do so because I got to see her happy again. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 @MONTH1 not know @CAPS4 sister, but she felt so much better that I got to enjoy the movie even more. I got to enjoy it more because I saw @PERSON3 happier, and not complaining or whining about any pain. This helped strengthen out relationhsip together because of the actors, she loved watching them both in this movie, and thanked me for it after it the movie was over. Although the movie does have dirty jokes, and is rated '@CAPS3' for it's profound language throughout, it is completely hilarious! @PERSON3 has loved this movie since she rented it, and bought it the next day at the store-for a good price-and has always loved watching it whenever she was feeling sad or stressed about something going on. I knew that this movie would help her enough to get her mind out of the pain. The saying, ""laughter is the best medicine,"" although @CAPS4 sister @MONTH1 not always fully agree helps her out more than she will ever know. During the movie, @CAPS4 sister would always laugh or gasp at a joke, and we would both just start laughing (sometimes we had to pause the movie because it was too funny) and I saw that we were getting closer as sisters. We had something in common that we both liked, a lot, and it made me feel better and I know her as well that we weren't fighting or arguing but enjoying each other's company. @CAPS4 mother came in at one point while we were watching the movie because she wanted to see what was so funny, and @CAPS4 mom ended up leaving because she doesn't really like the jokes in the movie. After that, @PERSON3 had to pause the movie again and both of us cracked up laughing all over again because of how traditional our mother is.  Although laughter helps a lot of the time, to get @PERSON3 to not focus on her pain even more I knew I would have to pick a romantic comedy because the romance gives her another dose of ""no pain."" @CAPS4 sister is a stereotypical girl who loves her 'chick flicks' and helps her get out of a 'funk.' @CAPS5 the romance and the humor that came out of it was one of the main reasons why she wasn't complaining. She was focused just on the movie, even though she knew what was going to happen in the end.

What I did know was that I wanted to excel in joining new groups for sports, grades, and friends. I was an average student that got nervous about how well I would do for grades and what the people would be like before I started middle school. I could already picture loads of homework and more drama. It saddened me to see that my close friends were off to a different middle school and I was no longer in elementary where I felt as if I was on top of the world, when everything came easy from sports to tests. I had been in classic soccer for the past few years and had to incorporate that into my time as well. I was glad to see that somethings didn't change. I had also decided to join my church youth group to get involved and even join cross country to help out with my soccer skills. The thought of being busy actually made me quite happy knowing I was going to be with people my age most of the time. I had soccer games on the week ends, practice @DATE1 and @DATE2, cross-country running everyday after school @DATE4 through @DATE5, and youth group on @DATE1 nights. I tried my best to have a positive attitude, after all, my years at elementary school were great how could this be any different? Cross country was a new challenge for that got me excited. There was competition I never experienced before and more motivational competition. It had also made me better in soccer, which was a big payoff. Once I started doing races I only wanted to get better in my times, and once I succeed, that just motivated me even more. I loved the feeling I got and the energy it gave me to do just about anything. I became more excited about soccer so I could run even more and get better. The days that I went from cross-country to soccer were the best because cross-country just got me hyped for soccer. Soccer then got me hyped for youth group that started at seven. I even had a girl on my team that also went straight to youth group too, so carpooling with her was fun. Things seemed to be going well in the athletic department, but time was soon catching and it became harder to keep up with school. I would have to come straight home from whatever I was doing and start on my homework. I had also started to get distant from friends and not having time for them really killed my mood. I loved talking on the phone discussing school and getting to know people. I even missed hanging out with my friends on the weekends. Spending time with them was kind of like therapy for me, I could tell them anything about life and just plain have fun. I began to get tired of being booked all the time and never having time to relax. I was stressed beyond what I could handle. One day after my cross-country, soccer, and youth group, I thought I would have time for my homework but ended up staying up way too late to the point of exhaustion. It was hard for me to enjoy anything anymore. I decided that I needed a break so on @DATE3 I would spend time with one of my close friends. We went to her house and also went to the towns pool for some fun. We talked about everything from school to home life. We joked a lot about the little things we did and I found myself laughing more.  I remembered that laughing is that good feeling when nothing matters but enjoying yourself. I knew that I needed this.

69,21726,8," A few days ago my family and I went up to a place called @ORGANIZATION1. My aunt owns it, and every year closes it down and holds a family reunion that we all gather at. Its out in the middle of nowhere and a few hours away with no cell phone reception, so from the start I could tell this wasn't going to be a easy trip. Being stuck in the middle of nowhere with nobody to talk to, but old people and no cell service isn't easy I tell you what! When we arrived, we were greated with this nasty food she claimed it was soup, but I had never tasted soup that foul before in my life. The horror and nightmares that my aunts cooking gave me still gives me terrors today. She assigns rooms for every single person that comes and this year I had the lucky honer to share a bed with my mother, it was kind of lame. I went on a walk down by the river with my mom, and got aten alive by the misquetos to say the least and then almost fell down the hill while trying to return up to the main part of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 where they were serving orderves. I was so hungry, but I did not by any means want to touch another one of anything that my aunt cooked, let alone put it in my mouth and eat it.  Soon after the orderves we had dinner, the dinner was not too bad but it was still pretty awful and I would not eat it again even if I was paid too. During the time that people were eating, my two year old nephew, was running and chasing these other girls and tripped and fell down the cement stairs and got a huge knot on his head and a fat cut by his eye. So I am sure by now that the assumption can be made that this @DATE1 that the reunion was held was not the best of weekends, nor my favorite family reuinons but this was by far not the end of the troubles that happened. After the gathering of people getting together for dinner we eventually parted and went back to our rooms that we had.  Along with no cell phone resecption there was no wifi or telivision, so my mom had brought her laptop to watch a movie on to help pass the time. It was a new movie that ad just came out, I was pretty exicted to watch it but of course, something had to happen so we could not watch it. It said that she had to download some program from the internet and there was no internet at @ORGANIZATION1. I tried to pass the hours by taking a shower, with shampoo still in my hair, the water started to run cold after only about five minutes of being in it. So that attempt to pass the time was a failed attempt. Thankfully I had brought my @CAPS1 touch with me and just had downloaded some games to play. Not too long after turning it off, it died. Finally ending the night I went to and laid in bed only to find it was like laying on a brick. The bed was one of the most uncomforable beds I have ever tried to sleep in, in my life.  The next morning went a little better, until the car ride to come home, but I will get to that in a little bit. We woke up and ate breakfast around nine, everyone was up at the dining room and it was all going well so far, but as soon as I started to think it was going well things changed. Breakfast was french toast on french bread made by one of the most annoying people I have ever met in my life, I am not sure how she is related to me but all I can say is thank goodness that this reunion was ending right after we all had ate. She served up my plate and I can noy eat if my food is touching so I said I would serve my own plate, but of course she insisted on doing it and pourposly made everything touch together it seemed like. I had finally found a food that was not repulsing and she ruined that for me.  Leaving as soon as we were done eating, I jumped in the car as fast as I could. I rode with my brother, his girlfriend, and my nephew.

My aunt owns it, and every year closes it down and holds a family reunion that we all gather at. Its out in the middle of nowhere and a few hours away with no cell phone reception, so from the start I could tell this wasn't going to be a easy trip. Being stuck in the middle of nowhere with nobody to talk to, but old people and no cell service isn't easy I tell you what! When we arrived, we were greated with this nasty food she claimed it was soup, but I had never tasted soup that foul before in my life. The horror and nightmares that my aunts cooking gave me still gives me terrors today. She assigns rooms for every single person that comes and this year I had the lucky honer to share a bed with my mother, it was kind of lame. I went on a walk down by the river with my mom, and got aten alive by the misquetos to say the least and then almost fell down the hill while trying to return up to the main part of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 where they were serving orderves. I was so hungry, but I did not by any means want to touch another one of anything that my aunt cooked, let alone put it in my mouth and eat it. Soon after the orderves we had dinner, the dinner was not too bad but it was still pretty awful and I would not eat it again even if I was paid too. During the time that people were eating, my two year old nephew, was running and chasing these other girls and tripped and fell down the cement stairs and got a huge knot on his head and a fat cut by his eye. So I am sure by now that the assumption can be made that this @DATE1 that the reunion was held was not the best of weekends, nor my favorite family reuinons but this was by far not the end of the troubles that happened. After the gathering of people getting together for dinner we eventually parted and went back to our rooms that we had. Along with no cell phone resecption there was no wifi or telivision, so my mom had brought her laptop to watch a movie on to help pass the time. It was a new movie that ad just came out, I was pretty exicted to watch it but of course, something had to happen so we could not watch it. It said that she had to download some program from the internet and there was no internet at @ORGANIZATION1. I tried to pass the hours by taking a shower, with shampoo still in my hair, the water started to run cold after only about five minutes of being in it. So that attempt to pass the time was a failed attempt. Thankfully I had brought my @CAPS1 touch with me and just had downloaded some games to play. Not too long after turning it off, it died. Finally ending the night I went to and laid in bed only to find it was like laying on a brick. The bed was one of the most uncomforable beds I have ever tried to sleep in, in my life. The next morning went a little better, until the car ride to come home, but I will get to that in a little bit. We woke up and ate breakfast around nine, everyone was up at the dining room and it was all going well so far, but as soon as I started to think it was going well things changed. Breakfast was french toast on french bread made by one of the most annoying people I have ever met in my life, I am not sure how she is related to me but all I can say is thank goodness that this reunion was ending right after we all had ate. She served up my plate and I can noy eat if my food is touching so I said I would serve my own plate, but of course she insisted on doing it and pourposly made everything touch together it seemed like. I had finally found a food that was not repulsing and she ruined that for me. Leaving as soon as we were done eating, I jumped in the car as fast as I could. I rode with my brother, his girlfriend, and my nephew. My nephew kept going to the bathroom and making the car smell disgusting and made me gag because I had to sit right next to him, and my brothers girlfriend just does not seem to say anything intellignet.

70,21729,8," Have you laughed today? This @MONTH1 sound like an unusual question, but it's something that you should ask yourself quite often because it could help you out in the long run. I believe that laughter is the basis of any form of relationship whether it @MONTH1 be a friendship, boyfriend/girlfriend, or family relationship. Laughter helps mold and fix bonds, connections, and creates more memories and stories that you and the person you are with can laugh about later on in life. With laughter you can tell what kind of sense of humor a person has because you know the type of humor that the person likes and that can help you make more friends.  When you are laughing you are generally a happy-go-lucky person and enjoy who you are with. Laughter can cause something to evolve such as a friendship could form into a romantic relationship or a family member could become your best friend. According to some research, you can tell if someone likes you if the person laughs at your jokes even if they are really dumb jokes. Although, laughter @MONTH1 not always be a sign of happiness and joy, it @MONTH1 just be a way of someone hiding the way that they actually feel. Either way laughter can be really helpful when you do or @CAPS1't have anyone. Laughter has the ability to connect two people even closer and allow them to get to know each other even more and help them become closer.   One night I was going to spend the night at my friend @PERSON1' house. We were just hanging out in her room, watching music videos, and practically falling asleep because it wasn't exactly the most exciting thing that a teenager could or would want to do. All of a sudden this video popped up that had a bunch of little kids in it and it sparked a conversation. We just started talking about how we wish we were kids again because things were a lot easier. Then we started sharing our childhood memories no matter if they were good or bad. Granted that a majority of them were good memories and they made us laugh. Karrine and I spent the whole night sharing stories and laughing the whole time because of our stories, and even though we hadn't been together to experience each others childhoods, it felt as though we had been because we had shared so much in a certain amount of time that it just got stuck in each others heads. Whenever we hang out now we always laugh about the stories especially the one where I thought that pennies were worth the same amount as dollars and I tried to pay for the groceries when my mom and I had gone to the store. She was reaching into her purse to get the money out and I lifted my tiny toddler hand and said to her ""@CAPS1't worry mom, I've got this."" That story could make us laugh for days and sometimes it did. We hangout a lot more now hoping to tell each other more stories so we could have a good laugh. Laughing really helped out our friendship because before we didn't really talk that much or hangout as often as we do, and laughing really strengthened our friendship. Laughter was a very big and very important part of that, we are now best friends because we enjoy being with each other and we get along a whole lot better then other people.  Once you actually take the time to think about it you will realize that some, if not all, of your closest friends are the people that make you laugh. That's completely understandable because why would you want to hang out with a negative @PERSON2 or a temper mental @CAPS2? The thing is you wouldn't want to unless arguing and crying is your thing. You want to hang out with people that help you with your problems when you are confused, help you out when you are on the verge of tears, give you advice when you have a major or minor dispute with the boyfriend or girlfriend, but most importantly you want a friend that can make you laugh and smile.  Picture your life being like a building, the wood and building blocks would be your friends and experiences, and the laughter would be the cement or glue that holds everything in place. Without the cement being there, the building would eventually crumble all the way to the ground and cause frustration because you'd have to rebuild it. Laughter increases happiness and your life span and with a longer life you can surely laugh a whole lot more. Laughing about things is healthy, learn not to sweat the small stuff, and make sure that smiling and laughing are a part of your daily routine.",24729,41,32,886,4426,4.079006772,27.6875, have you laughed today  this sound like an unusual question  but it s something that you should ask yourself quite often because it could help you out in the long run  i believe that laughter is the basis of any form of relationship whether it be a friendship  boyfriend girlfriend  or family relationship  laughter helps mold and fix bonds  connections  and creates more memories and stories that you and the person you are with can laugh about later on in life  with laughter you can tell what kind of sense of humor a person has because you know the type of humor that the person likes and that can help you make more friends   when you are laughing you are generally a happy go lucky person and enjoy who you are with  laughter can cause something to evolve such as a friendship could form into a romantic relationship or a family member could become your best friend  according to some research  you can tell if someone likes you if the person laughs at your jokes even if they are really dumb jokes  although  laughter not always be a sign of happiness and joy  it just be a way of someone hiding the way that they actually feel  either way laughter can be really helpful when you do or have anyone  laughter has the ability to connect two people even closer and allow them to get to know each other even more and help them become closer    one night i was going to spend the night at my friend house  we were just hanging out in her room  watching music videos  and practically falling asleep because it wasn t exactly the most exciting thing that a teenager could or would want to do  all of a sudden this video popped up that had a bunch of little kids in it and it sparked a conversation  we just started talking about how we wish we were kids again because things were a lot easier  then we started sharing our childhood memories no matter if they were good or bad  granted that a majority of them were good memories and they made us laugh  karrine and i spent the whole night sharing stories and laughing the whole time because of our stories  and even though we hadn t been together to experience each others childhoods  it felt as though we had been because we had shared so much in a certain amount of time that it just got stuck in each others heads  whenever we hang out now we always laugh about the stories especially the one where i thought that pennies were worth the same amount as dollars and i tried to pay for the groceries when my mom and i had gone to the store  she was reaching into her purse to get the money out and i lifted my tiny toddler hand and said to her   caps t worry mom  i ve got this   that story could make us laugh for days and sometimes it did  we hangout a lot more now hoping to tell each other more stories so we could have a good laugh  laughing really helped out our friendship because before we didn t really talk that much or hangout as often as we do  and laughing really strengthened our friendship  laughter was a very big and very important part of that  we are now best friends because we enjoy being with each other and we get along a whole lot better then other people   once you actually take the time to think about it you will realize that some  if not all  of your closest friends are the people that make you laugh  that s completely understandable because why would you want to hang out with a negative or a temper mental the thing is you wouldn t want to unless arguing and crying is your thing  you want to hang out with people that help you with your problems when you are confused  help you out when you are on the verge of tears  give you advice when you have a major or minor dispute with the boyfriend or girlfriend  but most importantly you want a friend that can make you laugh and smile   picture your life being like a building  the wood and building blocks would be your friends and experiences  and the laughter would be the cement or glue that holds everything in place  without the cement being there  the building would eventually crumble all the way to the ground and cause frustration because you d have to rebuild it  laughter increases happiness and your life span and with a longer life you can surely laugh a whole lot more  laughing about things is healthy  learn not to sweat the small stuff  and make sure that smiling and laughing are a part of your daily routine ,1065,108,120,150,51,45,57,123,4,"Have you laughed today?

73,21733,8," I don't think the importance of laughter will ever be completely understood, even though it's an unconcious action. Laughter is a right of passage, being able to laugh and have a good time brings people together. Laughter bring you and others around you together. Topics to laugh about are limitless. If you really focused on the things you laugh about its kind of dumbfounding. Example:what you see, how things/people look or act, what people say, the possibilites are endless.   When I'm with my friends i always seem to laugh more. One friend in particular, her name is @CAPS1. She has a couple of acres of land, one time we decided to take her quad out for a spin.

75,21735,8,"  Throughout time, it's been said that laughter is the best medicine, and although that @MONTH1 seem a bit silly, it also seems believable. Laughter is an incredibly universal thing, unlike language, since different forms of it can't be understood by all. That's why when someone said ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" it was absolutely true. Things like laughter and smiles are something that everyone is familiar with, no matter what language they speak or where they come from, so it's essential to being social.  There are not many stories that people can tell that are specifically about the laughter, but more that the laughter revolves around what was said or what happened. Thinking about places with a lot of laughter, one could imagine big family gatherings where old stories are shared or a group of friends just hanging out wherever and having a good time. In any case, it's almost always a good thing. Not too long ago, while I was walking with a group of friends, I wasn't paying much attention to my footing at all, so my shoe slipped into a crack in the sidewalk and I started to fall, almost hitting the concrete face first. While it was slightly scary and would have hurt really badly had I not caught my balance, everyone laughed about it afterward, including myself. I think it's important to be able to laugh at the little things, because you have to be able to laugh at life sometimes. If I hadn't laughed at myself, the whole situation would have just felt strange and out of place.  You can instantly feel more comfortable around someone if you laugh together about anything, because there is less of a sense of insecurity on either part. Laughter is warm, inviting and tends to make people seem instantly more likeable because they seem like someone who likes to have fun. In tense or awkward situations, the funny person who is always making jokes is a real stress reliever, because the laughter often cuts through the tension. Without laughter, you could never really be as close to people, because laughter almost always signifies a good things. If you have a good time with people, you'd obviously want to be around them more, so it leads to stronger friendships. When you later reminisce on times with a lot of laughter, they are obviously good memories, things that were happy.  Laughter is not only essential to being social, but essential to everything.

Looking back, people should not see the times of gloom and sadness that they endured, but they should always remember the best times they had.","Throughout time, it's been said that laughter is the best medicine, and although that @MONTH1 seem a bit silly, it also seems believable. Laughter is an incredibly universal thing, unlike language, since different forms of it can't be understood by all. That's why when someone said ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" it was absolutely true. Things like laughter and smiles are something that everyone is familiar with, no matter what language they speak or where they come from, so it's essential to being social. There are not many stories that people can tell that are specifically about the laughter, but more that the laughter revolves around what was said or what happened. Thinking about places with a lot of laughter, one could imagine big family gatherings where old stories are shared or a group of friends just hanging out wherever and having a good time. In any case, it's almost always a good thing. Not too long ago, while I was walking with a group of friends, I wasn't paying much attention to my footing at all, so my shoe slipped into a crack in the sidewalk and I started to fall, almost hitting the concrete face first. While it was slightly scary and would have hurt really badly had I not caught my balance, everyone laughed about it afterward, including myself. I think it's important to be able to laugh at the little things, because you have to be able to laugh at life sometimes. If I hadn't laughed at myself, the whole situation would have just felt strange and out of place. You can instantly feel more comfortable around someone if you laugh together about anything, because there is less of a sense of insecurity on either part. Laughter is warm, inviting and tends to make people seem instantly more likeable because they seem like someone who likes to have fun. In tense or awkward situations, the funny person who is always making jokes is a real stress reliever, because the laughter often cuts through the tension. Without laughter, you could never really be as close to people, because laughter almost always signifies a good things. If you have a good time with people, you'd obviously want to be around them more, so it leads to stronger friendships. When you later reminisce on times with a lot of laughter, they are obviously good memories, things that were happy. Laughter is not only essential to being social, but essential to everything.

76,21738,8," Laughter is important to us all. It keeps smiles on all our faces, even when times get hard.  I had a great grandfather whom we called ""@CAPS1 @PERSON1"". He was the kindest person I'd ever been lucky enough to call a part of my family. He lived next to @LOCATION1, straight across a field, where we could see the @NUM1 of @DATE2 fireworks light up the sky right in our own backyard. I thought that was the coolest thing in the world, and would brag to all my friends about how I had the greatest grandpa ever, just because he lived so close. When I was six years old he had us come down and took us to @LOCATION1, that was the last time I got to see him before he died.  In @DATE3, he died suddenly of a heart attack. We didn't find out for a while after, because he did not live here. His funeral was set for the @NUM2 of @DATE1, a week after we'd found out he had past away, and we planned to attend accordingly. I had went out and bought a nice dress for the funeral because I felt I needed to be dressed up. My mother and sister did the same.  A week had past and we were on our way to @LOCATION2 by plane. I was grounded at the time so I was arrogant about going at all, being away from my friends to go to a sad funeral was not what I wanted to be doing. To make matters worse, my mom was yelling at me the whole ride to my grandpa's house about respect and to remind me that we were doing this because we loved him, and it was important to my family. So, I settled and was quiet as we pulled into the drive-way. Upon entering his home, I was shocked at how many people were there. I realized how much I loved and missed him. Tears began streaming down my face, I walked into the corner of the kitchen, and sat by myself for a while.  Though I had been there before I hadn't seen his whole house. There were rooms full of history and memories of his life. I learned about my family from before my grandparents were even born! It was all so new to me. Then came the sad part of the funeral. At first, no one there seemed sad at all. But, now came the time to look back on his life. I dreaded this part more than anything. Oh, how I longed to be anywhere but there. First up to speak was my grandpa, his adopted son. He had made a spectacular poster, filled with pictures of himself and @CAPS1 @PERSON1. He told the tale of how he came to be his son and how @CAPS1 @PERSON1 was always there for him through thick and thin. Not an eye was dry after my grandpa's speech. I was ready to leave after that, for I could not stand all of the sadness that filled the entire room. Yet, I had to remain seated and listen out of respect for my family. After my grandpa, came one of @CAPS1 @PERSON1's long-time friend/business partners. I expected another story that would make us all begin crying over again, but I was wrong. His speech was of the great life he had lived. According to him, my @CAPS1 @PERSON1 was a bit of a ladies man. Man, what a life he had; girls, money, cars. Things I should have figured out by exploring his home, though, it seemed as if he wasn't gone hearing it from a person who had actually lived it with him. The mood of the whole ceremony turned completely around. There were people laughing and reminiscing the life he had. I learned so many new things about my grandpa that day. Then, after that, the thought of him being gone didn't bring me to tears anymore. In fact, I smiled. I believe that's how my @CAPS1 would've wanted it. Without the humor brought to the remembrance of @CAPS1 @PERSON1; my family would still be mourning over him. We miss him, very much, but I know he wouldn't be happy if we didn't look back and smile upon remembering him as the fun-loving and giving person he was.

Without laughter life would be dark, depressing and sad. Laughing is an amazing feeling. My best friend @CAPS1 makes me laugh all the time. Non-stop laughing for hours. @CAPS1 and I have made @CAPS6 many memories that involve laughter. I don't even think i can name them all, but there is one that i will never forget. It was @DATE1 @TIME1 and I was already very bored. I wanted to go to my friends house, but I knew my parents were not going to let me. They were already in a bad mood from my brothers who hadn't cleaned their room in forever. Suddenly an idea popped into my head. What if i cleaned their room for them. Then my parents will defiantly let me go. @CAPS6 I talked to my mom and she was thrilled. Their room hadn't been cleaned in months. It wasn't a pigs sty, it was worse. Their room looked like a tornado had swept through it about a million times. It was @CAPS6 messy my mom even agreed that she would pay me and my friend thirty dollars to clean the room. @CAPS6 I called my friend and asked her to come help me clean my brothers room. I warned her about what it looked like, but she still agreed to come help me.  @CAPS1 arrived and we were ready to clean @PERSON1's and @CAPS2's room. We walked into the room and she could not believe how messy it was. She saw it and exclaimed, ""@CAPS3 is going to take us hours to clean!"" We didn't know @CAPS7 to begin, @CAPS6 we started with the big stuff. The blankets were thrown everywhere, @CAPS6 we picked those up and folded them. Then we went on to the dirty clothes. After that came the toys and random junk. We just shoved all of @CAPS3 into boxes, then shoved all of the boxes into one of my brothers closets. I vacuumed, then we made the beds. The room looked amazing. It was a miracle that my brothers room was finally clean. It only took me and @CAPS1 three hours.  I ran down the stairs yelling, "" @CAPS5! @CAPS5! You have to come see @CAPS3!"" @CAPS6 he slowly walked up the steps and finally he opened the door to my brothers room. My dads jaw dropped. He could not believe how clean it was. He was astonished. He went inside the room and was surprised when he had floor space to walk. Then he asked the question that i had been dreading, ""@CAPS7 did you guys put all of there stuff?"" That's when we smiled and had suspicious looks in our eyes. He knew @CAPS7 we had put all of the stuff. He started walking towards the closet. I yelled, "" @CAPS8 @CAPS5 don't open that!"", but it was to late. Everything sprung out of my brothers closet and my @CAPS5 was buried. It was hilarious. Seeing that was like something you would see in a cartoon. We pulled stuff off of him while laughing. My friend laughed @CAPS6 hard she peed her pants. Then because of that we laughed harder and we couldn't stop. My @CAPS5 even joined in on laughing and that doesn't happen often.  Laughter really is an important part of everything. Laughter can make even the dullest of things adventurous. My friend and I both hate cleaning, but seeing my @CAPS5 buried in all that junk was defiantly worth it. Having those moments of laughter made everything that day better. Laughter can cure even the worst of moods. Laughter brings people together. It helps make friendships.

We didn't know @CAPS7 to begin, @CAPS6 we started with the big stuff. The blankets were thrown everywhere, @CAPS6 we picked those up and folded them. Then we went on to the dirty clothes. After that came the toys and random junk. We just shoved all of @CAPS3 into boxes, then shoved all of the boxes into one of my brothers closets. I vacuumed, then we made the beds. The room looked amazing. It was a miracle that my brothers room was finally clean. It only took me and @CAPS1 three hours. I ran down the stairs yelling, "" @CAPS5! @CAPS5! You have to come see @CAPS3!"" @CAPS6 he slowly walked up the steps and finally he opened the door to my brothers room. My dads jaw dropped. He could not believe how clean it was. He was astonished. He went inside the room and was surprised when he had floor space to walk. Then he asked the question that i had been dreading, ""@CAPS7 did you guys put all of there stuff?"" That's when we smiled and had suspicious looks in our eyes. He knew @CAPS7 we had put all of the stuff. He started walking towards the closet. I yelled, "" @CAPS8 @CAPS5 don't open that!"", but it was to late. Everything sprung out of my brothers closet and my @CAPS5 was buried. It was hilarious. Seeing that was like something you would see in a cartoon. We pulled stuff off of him while laughing. My friend laughed @CAPS6 hard she peed her pants. Then because of that we laughed harder and we couldn't stop. My @CAPS5 even joined in on laughing and that doesn't happen often. Laughter really is an important part of everything. Laughter can make even the dullest of things adventurous. My friend and I both hate cleaning, but seeing my @CAPS5 buried in all that junk was defiantly worth it. Having those moments of laughter made everything that day better. Laughter can cure even the worst of moods. Laughter brings people together. It helps make friendships. Laughter is an important part of life.","Laughter is like medicine. When your feeling down or just having a bad day, laughter can turn that around in seconds. Its fun to laugh, laughing brightens everything. Without laughter life would be dark, depressing and sad. Laughing is an amazing feeling. My best friend @CAPS1 makes me laugh all the time. Non-stop laughing for hours. @CAPS1 and I have made @CAPS6 many memories that involve laughter. I don't even think i can name them all, but there is one that i will never forget. It was @DATE1 @TIME1 and I was already very bored. I wanted to go to my friends house, but I knew my parents were not going to let me. They were already in a bad mood from my brothers who hadn't cleaned their room in forever. Suddenly an idea popped into my head. What if i cleaned their room for them. Then my parents will defiantly let me go. @CAPS6 I talked to my mom and she was thrilled. Their room hadn't been cleaned in months. It wasn't a pigs sty, it was worse. Their room looked like a tornado had swept through it about a million times. It was @CAPS6 messy my mom even agreed that she would pay me and my friend thirty dollars to clean the room. @CAPS6 I called my friend and asked her to come help me clean my brothers room. I warned her about what it looked like, but she still agreed to come help me. @CAPS1 arrived and we were ready to clean @PERSON1's and @CAPS2's room.

79,21743,8," One sunny afternoon around three o'clock there was this scrathing sound on the wall of my bedroom, and my friends and I had no clue what it had to be. Everyone was in the room nobody else was home as we looked every where that the sound could be coming from the dog, the cat, and still couldn't figure it out. But everytime we had gotten up out of my room the strange disterbing noise would stop. As we would proceed with the activities of just being girls in my room laughing, talking about boys, and painting our nails we would hear it again, but it only would happen when we would start laughing at each other as if something that was said was funny which usually wasn't just so hyper that anything anyone of us said we would burst into laughs. But then we start laughing at some silly joke when the noise in the wall kept on going. So we got up again and looked every where which then it had stopped. Alright so now we are actually getting kinda scared because we don't know what the heck this sound is. We kept thinking the worst like is something in the house is the dog here, is the cat here we did not know what it could be and at this momment we were all freaked out.  As we went back into my room to watch some television when we all fell off the bed and started laughing so hard that most of us were crying like it was raining outside. Then we heard it, the sound it had to be coming from outside so all of us grabbed shoes and headed outside. We were so scared we looked like a ball all cuddled up together as we were walking in a huge group. So as we are heading outside laughing we could still hear the sound so we start running trying to findout what the heck it is before it stops. As we are being super quiet it stops again so we had to back insided after looking for about an hour we headed inside to finish our television show that was almost over when the t.v. turned off all by itself. As that happened now we were all scared. I think someone is trying to pull a prank on us but yet everyone was laughing when the t.v. shut off. I didn't think that it was too funny myself but since we were laughing the horrible sounding noise started again and again we looked harder this time and still couldn't figure out what it was. We were getting so frustrated that we wanted to just stop trying. We looked looked and looked. We couldn't figure out what it was, but then I got a idea one of my friends said we can all start laughing it be a fake laughing and go all around the house. We can split up so everyone split in different rooms. I wasn't to sure because I didn't want to get scared but maybe this was a good idea. When we all split up we started laughing then the television turned back on as we were hearing this disturbing sound still we kept looking and looking. I thought to myself we are never going to figure out this sound I hope my parents come home soon! As we heard the loudest scream ever we all race into my bedroom where the scream came from and it was just my friend and my little sister.

Everyone was in the room nobody else was home as we looked every where that the sound could be coming from the dog, the cat, and still couldn't figure it out. But everytime we had gotten up out of my room the strange disterbing noise would stop. As we would proceed with the activities of just being girls in my room laughing, talking about boys, and painting our nails we would hear it again, but it only would happen when we would start laughing at each other as if something that was said was funny which usually wasn't just so hyper that anything anyone of us said we would burst into laughs. But then we start laughing at some silly joke when the noise in the wall kept on going. So we got up again and looked every where which then it had stopped. Alright so now we are actually getting kinda scared because we don't know what the heck this sound is. We kept thinking the worst like is something in the house is the dog here, is the cat here we did not know what it could be and at this momment we were all freaked out. As we went back into my room to watch some television when we all fell off the bed and started laughing so hard that most of us were crying like it was raining outside. Then we heard it, the sound it had to be coming from outside so all of us grabbed shoes and headed outside. We were so scared we looked like a ball all cuddled up together as we were walking in a huge group. So as we are heading outside laughing we could still hear the sound so we start running trying to findout what the heck it is before it stops. As we are being super quiet it stops again so we had to back insided after looking for about an hour we headed inside to finish our television show that was almost over when the t.v. turned off all by itself. As that happened now we were all scared. I think someone is trying to pull a prank on us but yet everyone was laughing when the t.v. shut off. I didn't think that it was too funny myself but since we were laughing the horrible sounding noise started again and again we looked harder this time and still couldn't figure out what it was. We were getting so frustrated that we wanted to just stop trying. We looked looked and looked. We couldn't figure out what it was, but then I got a idea one of my friends said we can all start laughing it be a fake laughing and go all around the house. We can split up so everyone split in different rooms. I wasn't to sure because I didn't want to get scared but maybe this was a good idea. When we all split up we started laughing then the television turned back on as we were hearing this disturbing sound still we kept looking and looking. I thought to myself we are never going to figure out this sound I hope my parents come home soon! As we heard the loudest scream ever we all race into my bedroom where the scream came from and it was just my friend and my little sister. We had no clue she had been hiding in there all this time and was messing with us.

81,21746,8,"                                                Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3  Laughter has been a huge part of @CAPS8 life. There are many times recently that laughter has proven to be the shortest distance between people. During this year @CAPS8 friend @PERSON1 and I became very close after fighting a lot over the @DATE1 and past years. Our friendship grew over our love of laughing. What ever the two of us are doing it involves some kind of laughter.  @PERSON1 invited me over to her house right @CAPS12 eight grade started to hang out. When I got over there we talked for what seemed like hours. Once we had kind of warmed up to each other again we decided to make music videos to our favorite choir songs, ""@CAPS4 of the @CAPS5"" and ""@CAPS6 the @CAPS7"". We had her camera propped up in her kitchen and played the songs really loud on her speakers while we danced and sang along.  This got boring quickly and we decided to make brownies. @PERSON1 and I were having a grand time together acting like little kids again, but these brownies were to good to pass by. @CAPS10 we baked I realized the camera was still on, I ran to shut it off @CAPS12 it captured anything embarrassing. The brownies were mixed after two minutes of vigorous stirring. We then ate the batter @CAPS10 we poured in the well oiled pan quickly shoved them in the oven and ran off.  We ran down the hall to the entryway and found ourselves laying on the heated floor talking again. This time instead of chatting about our feuds and how we've been, we got into the girl stuff like boys and the latest gossip. Neither of us liked any boys or knew the gossip (we were both very out of the loop) so we quickly changed subjects. The subject change led us no where so we whipped out our cell phones and played with the camera feature. This @MONTH1 seem lame but we experimented with many tricks of the camera, negative, black and white, the fun frames and had a great time. I took a picture of her camera in negative, @PERSON1 then took a picture in negative of @CAPS8 phone with the picture up. Her camera went back to @CAPS2 normal color. This amazed us so much, then realized how obvious it was and laughed @CAPS1 our selves. After a while we heard the timer go off, our brownies were done.  Just @CAPS10 fast @CAPS10 we ran out of the kitchen we ran back. While the brownies cooled we stayed in the kitchen to wait and I fell. I fell right to @CAPS8 bottom. In @CAPS8 head I remember slow motion running in one spot and because of @CAPS8 sock on hard wood contact I slipped. Once on the ground @PERSON1 was laughing and it wasn't too painful, so I joined her.   She exclaimed, ""That was the coolest thing ever!"" I had to agree, but I replied to her statement with a simple that-hurt-don't-make-fun-of-me look that she knows well. The brownies were finally cool enough to eat, we both had three large pieces. We made it back to her entryway with brownies in hand. There we continued to take pictures, the camera was set in black and white while we posed behind it with funny faces. Of course now we had to let our stomachs settle @CAPS12 tackling the trampoline.  We went outside to be the kids still inside from earlier. Playing the same games we played when were younger. These games even now seem to crack us up, with our now heavier weights making it almost impossible to jump. @PERSON1 and I were constantly falling down, scrambling to get back up, laughing @CAPS1 each others failed attempts @CAPS1 anything we tried. After trying so hard to stand up I gave up and stayed down to ask @PERSON1 a question.  ""@CAPS8 favorite movie isFinding @CAPS9, yours?"" @CAPS10 random @CAPS10 it sounds it sprung an interesting conversation. @PERSON1 started to say, ""@CAPS8 favorite little kid movie...""  @CAPS12 she could finish I interrupted saying thatFinding @CAPS9 was not @CAPS8 favorite little kid movie but @CAPS8 all time favorite. All we could do was laugh @CAPS1 her mistake. @CAPS1 the end of the day filled with tons of joy and laughter we said our good-byes most likely till school. Both of us knowing our friendship was saved because of this day. It was also saved because of our laughter. Hanging out with @PERSON1 was one of the many times laughter has proven to be the shortest distance between two people. I now know that the @CAPS3 way to heal or even recreate a friendship is by using laughter to connect two people together. I would have never learned this if we hadn't discovered our connection is laughter.

We had her camera propped up in her kitchen and played the songs really loud on her speakers while we danced and sang along.

The brownies were mixed after two minutes of vigorous stirring. We then ate the batter @CAPS10 we poured in the well oiled pan quickly shoved them in the oven and ran off. We ran down the hall to the entryway and found ourselves laying on the heated floor talking again. This time instead of chatting about our feuds and how we've been, we got into the girl stuff like boys and the latest gossip. Neither of us liked any boys or knew the gossip (we were both very out of the loop) so we quickly changed subjects. The subject change led us no where so we whipped out our cell phones and played with the camera feature. This @MONTH1 seem lame but we experimented with many tricks of the camera, negative, black and white, the fun frames and had a great time. I took a picture of her camera in negative, @PERSON1 then took a picture in negative of @CAPS8 phone with the picture up. Her camera went back to @CAPS2 normal color. This amazed us so much, then realized how obvious it was and laughed @CAPS1 our selves. After a while we heard the timer go off, our brownies were done. Just @CAPS10 fast @CAPS10 we ran out of the kitchen we ran back. While the brownies cooled we stayed in the kitchen to wait and I fell. I fell right to @CAPS8 bottom. In @CAPS8 head I remember slow motion running in one spot and because of @CAPS8 sock on hard wood contact I slipped. Once on the ground @PERSON1 was laughing and it wasn't too painful, so I joined her. She exclaimed, ""That was the coolest thing ever!"" I had to agree, but I replied to her statement with a simple that-hurt-don't-make-fun-of-me look that she knows well. The brownies were finally cool enough to eat, we both had three large pieces. We made it back to her entryway with brownies in hand. There we continued to take pictures, the camera was set in black and white while we posed behind it with funny faces. Of course now we had to let our stomachs settle @CAPS12 tackling the trampoline. We went outside to be the kids still inside from earlier. Playing the same games we played when were younger. These games even now seem to crack us up, with our now heavier weights making it almost impossible to jump. @PERSON1 and I were constantly falling down, scrambling to get back up, laughing @CAPS1 each others failed attempts @CAPS1 anything we tried. After trying so hard to stand up I gave up and stayed down to ask @PERSON1 a question.

Laughter could also be a bad thing, but not to the person @CAPS2 of course, they're getting a kick out of it.  I love @CAPS2 personally, it feels good to me. I especially love @CAPS2 so hard that my belly hurts and my cheeks are sore, and you can't even hold yourself up any longer. These types of laughter I usually share with my best friend's @PERSON2 and @PERSON1. Even @CAPS7 we're in a bad mood we will always find something to make us laugh. Sometimes it's video or a song but most of the time it's just us being ourselves and making silly faces being dorks. The best types of friendships are always spent with long fun filled days of laughter, because we all know it's good for the soul (superstitiously.) @CAPS2 can also be shared with family members, my brother and I like to talk about our day and how it went. Most the time it ends with us @CAPS2 about what happened. He works at @CAPS3-@CAPS4 and I go to school at @CAPS5 @CAPS6, we talk about the people that make us mad and about the stupid mistakes that we made. The best part about that is, when taking a step back and looking at what was ""horrid"" but in reality wasn't bad at all.  Why I love just getting with a few friends cracking jokes left and right or watching funny movies @CAPS2 with tears coming from our eyes. Is honestly because it feels good, I feel better about myself and I'm comfortable around the people that I got to share a good belly laugh with. Those are truly in my opinion the best laughs, well other than when your so upset about something then just start @CAPS2 realizing, it never even mattered! Those are some reasons why I absolutely love @CAPS2, it makes everything just simply, alright again. But the down side about laughter is that some people find the wrong things to be @CAPS2 at. Example: @CAPS7 someone gets hurt or picked on some people find that amusing and funny when in all reality that's cruel and childish. Violence shouldn't ever be found amusing unless you're watching some type of horror movie but people don't laugh at those, so why do they in reality?

I've had many fun good memories with laughter and those have been spent mostly with my best friend @PERSON2. We met one anther when we were only eight and nine, me being nine and her being eight. In time we realized that we really get along so her and her family invited me to a camping trip, I will never forget. We rode four wheelers all over the place, climbed trees like monkeys, and swam in lakes like ducks. But I think the funnest was when the sun went down, the grown ups got a little tipsy, and her grandpa asked me to dance. I was such a shy kid, but at least I learned how to swing dance with grandpa @CAPS8. Eventually we had to go to bed, so we climbed into our tent and told each others stories until everyone else fell asleep. Now here is when the real fun began, we decided now that the fire was gone and we couldn't see a thing. Not even @CAPS7 your hand was straight in front of your face. We turned on her lamp, knowing we'd get in trouble @CAPS7 we had left, so we found something entertaining for us to do, and that is when we started to play with shadow puppets. We made tons of silly looking creators that talked and chased one another. They were the funnest creators we have ever seen, but only one really seemed to stick. @CAPS9's, those were our favorite they were like dolls but they were your hand, imagine the doll you never lost. The childhood toy that will be there for the rest of your life. We played all night it seemed, @CAPS2 so hard it got hard to breathe, keep in mind we're only in a tent so we got yelled at and had to go to bed.

The best part about that is, when taking a step back and looking at what was ""horrid"" but in reality wasn't bad at all. Why I love just getting with a few friends cracking jokes left and right or watching funny movies @CAPS2 with tears coming from our eyes. Is honestly because it feels good, I feel better about myself and I'm comfortable around the people that I got to share a good belly laugh with. Those are truly in my opinion the best laughs, well other than when your so upset about something then just start @CAPS2 realizing, it never even mattered! Those are some reasons why I absolutely love @CAPS2, it makes everything just simply, alright again. But the down side about laughter is that some people find the wrong things to be @CAPS2 at. Example: @CAPS7 someone gets hurt or picked on some people find that amusing and funny when in all reality that's cruel and childish. Violence shouldn't ever be found amusing unless you're watching some type of horror movie but people don't laugh at those, so why do they in reality? Laughter @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be abused in some situations, but I believe that people should try to control inappropriate laughter. I've had many fun good memories with laughter and those have been spent mostly with my best friend @PERSON2. We met one anther when we were only eight and nine, me being nine and her being eight. In time we realized that we really get along so her and her family invited me to a camping trip, I will never forget. We rode four wheelers all over the place, climbed trees like monkeys, and swam in lakes like ducks. But I think the funnest was when the sun went down, the grown ups got a little tipsy, and her grandpa asked me to dance. I was such a shy kid, but at least I learned how to swing dance with grandpa @CAPS8. Eventually we had to go to bed, so we climbed into our tent and told each others stories until everyone else fell asleep. Now here is when the real fun began, we decided now that the fire was gone and we couldn't see a thing. Not even @CAPS7 your hand was straight in front of your face. We turned on her lamp, knowing we'd get in trouble @CAPS7 we had left, so we found something entertaining for us to do, and that is when we started to play with shadow puppets. We made tons of silly looking creators that talked and chased one another. They were the funnest creators we have ever seen, but only one really seemed to stick. @CAPS9's, those were our favorite they were like dolls but they were your hand, imagine the doll you never lost. The childhood toy that will be there for the rest of your life. We played all night it seemed, @CAPS2 so hard it got hard to breathe, keep in mind we're only in a tent so we got yelled at and had to go to bed. That was the best memory of my childhood with @PERSON2 and our shadow puppets, the @CAPS9's.",37,2,37,1,0,0,2,"['MANY_NN', 'DOWN_COMPOUNDS']","[' Laughter, bringing joy to many people all over the world.', 'Big jolly faces filled with smiles from ear to ear, children playing on school yards, your family members sitting on the couch watching there favorite @CAPS1 shows.', 'Laughter brings everyone together you laugh with your closest friends and family, bringing relationship between strangers closer.', 'I bet what you find humerus a million other people do too!', 'There is so many interest out in the world and laughter helps people find what they have in common.', ""Laughter could also be a bad thing, but not to the person @CAPS2 of course, they're getting a kick out of it."", 'I love @CAPS2 personally, it feels good to me.', ""I especially love @CAPS2 so hard that my belly hurts and my cheeks are sore, and you can't even hold yourself up any longer."", ""These types of laughter I usually share with my best friend's @PERSON2 and @PERSON1."", ""Even @CAPS7 we're in a bad mood we will always find something to make us laugh."", ""Sometimes it's video or a song but most of the time it's just us being ourselves and making silly faces being dorks."", ""The best types of friendships are always spent with long fun filled days of laughter, because we all know it's good for the soul (superstitiously.)"", '@CAPS2 can also be shared with family members, my brother and I like to talk about our day and how it went.', 'Most the time it ends with us @CAPS2 about what happened.', 'He works at @CAPS3-@CAPS4 and I go to school at @CAPS5 @CAPS6, we talk about the people that make us mad and about the stupid mistakes that we made.', 'The best part about that is, when taking a step back and looking at what was ""horrid"" but in reality wasn\'t bad at all.', 'Why I love just getting with a few friends cracking jokes left and right or watching funny movies @CAPS2 with tears coming from our eyes.', ""Is honestly because it feels good, I feel better about myself and I'm comfortable around the people that I got to share a good belly laugh with."", 'Those are truly in my opinion the best laughs, well other than when your so upset about something then just start @CAPS2 realizing, it never even mattered!', 'Those are some reasons why I absolutely love @CAPS2, it makes everything just simply, alright again.', 'But the down side about laughter is that some people find the wrong things to be @CAPS2 at.', ""Example: @CAPS7 someone gets hurt or picked on some people find that amusing and funny when in all reality that's cruel and childish."", ""Violence shouldn't ever be found amusing unless you're watching some type of horror movie but people don't laugh at those, so why do they in reality?"", 'Laughter @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be abused in some situations, but I believe that people should try to control inappropriate laughter.', ""I've had many fun good memories with laughter and those have been spent mostly with my best friend @PERSON2."", 'We met one anther when we were only eight and nine, me being nine and her being eight.', 'In time we realized that we really get along so her and her family invited me to a camping trip, I will never forget.', 'We rode four wheelers all over the place, climbed trees like monkeys, and swam in lakes like ducks.', 'But I think the funnest was when the sun went down, the grown ups got a little tipsy, and her grandpa asked me to dance.', 'I was such a shy kid, but at least I learned how to swing dance with grandpa @CAPS8.', 'Eventually we had to go to bed, so we climbed into our tent and told each others stories until everyone else fell asleep.', ""Now here is when the real fun began, we decided now that the fire was gone and we couldn't see a thing."", 'Not even @CAPS7 your hand was straight in front of your face.', ""We turned on her lamp, knowing we'd get in trouble @CAPS7 we had left, so we found something entertaining for us to do, and that is when we started to play with shadow puppets."", 'We made tons of silly looking creators that talked and chased one another.', 'They were the funnest creators we have ever seen, but only one really seemed to stick.', ""@CAPS9's, those were our favorite they were like dolls but they were your hand, imagine the doll you never lost."", 'The childhood toy that will be there for the rest of your life.', ""We played all night it seemed, @CAPS2 so hard it got hard to breathe, keep in mind we're only in a tent so we got yelled at and had to go to bed."", ""That was the best memory of my childhood with @PERSON2 and our shadow puppets, the @CAPS9's.""]",0.354648083,59.03475228,91.7225,5.235356016,6.263514894,296,0.314893617,557,0.001760584,13
83,21748,8," Memorable @CAPS1 @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4      One day when I was walking home from school, I got a random phone call from @CAPS21 @CAPS4 @PERSON1. It was a @DATE1. She wanted to know if I could come over to her house that day. I told her I didn'@CAPS12 know so I had to call her back to see if I could hang out or not. When I got home from walking home from school, I talked to @CAPS21 @CAPS5 about coming over. @CAPS21 @CAPS5 really likes @PERSON1 a lot. They get along well. @CAPS21 @CAPS5 didn'@CAPS12 know if I could go over to her house @DATE1 because she wanted me home. I let her think about what I should do. That night, @CAPS21 @CAPS5 gave me an answer to which if I could go over there or not and she said @CAPS19. I was so happy to actually go over there for the first time in a while. The last time I was there was on @CAPS8. So it was a while.   So that night, I waited until @NUM1 @CAPS9.M for her @CAPS5 to come pick me up because she was just getting off work. I was so excited to go because I haven'@CAPS12 been there in a while. Her @CAPS5 finally came and got me. I was so happy. When I finally got to @PERSON1's, she jumped on me because she hasn'@CAPS12 seen me in a while. I fell when she jumped on me. @PERSON1 just thought that was the most funniest thing ever. She even took a picture of me on the ground. That night, late, we were in her room hanging out, listening to music, and watching @CAPS12.V. We were up until @NUM2 in the morning making up funny jokes and stories. We were crazily laughing really loud that we woke her parents up. They told us to calm down, but we couldn'@CAPS12 because we were too busy having the time of our life! After they left, we still were having some fun. We started to be quiet a little bit, but then we realized we were being too loud again.    @NUM3 A.M came and we were still up laughing and having fun. ""@CAPS13, I never thought I could say this but I am crying @CAPS21 eyes out because I am really enjoying tonight!"" @PERSON1 said, joyfully. I was pretty happy she said that because it just was a nice thing to know that we were having fun and she liked it. ""I don'@CAPS12 think we could ever get bored tonight now."" I said. @PERSON1 is a fun person to hang out @CAPS2. She has the personality of a monkey! She's always so excited and I like that because of her. We finally gave up on having fun, and actually went to bed. We were exhausted and worn out because of all the fun we had. It was actually nice to have a good time like that @CAPS2 a good @CAPS4. We finally went to sleep and passed out.    Next morning came, and we were still very tired. We had to wake up for her brother's basketball game at @NUM4 o'clock. So yeah, you can tell we were very tired. I wanted to sleep in more, but we couldn'@CAPS12 because we had to go to his game to support his team. When we were going to his game, a really crazy song was on the radio that @PERSON1 did not like whatsoever. She told her @CAPS5 to turn it off, but she didn'@CAPS12 listen. @PERSON1 didn'@CAPS12 like this song because it was very annoying and she couldn'@CAPS12 stand listening to it. Her @CAPS5 finally turned it off because @PERSON1 was complaining about it. It was so funny what she was doing. I couldn'@CAPS12 stop laughing. We got to her brothers game just in time, and got ready for it to start. We were so bored during the whole process of sitting down and watching the game. @PERSON1 and I ended up walking back to her house because we got bored. Sadly, when we got back, I had to go home. I was sad because I didn'@CAPS12 want to go home, I wanted to stay @CAPS2 her longer. @CAPS21 @CAPS5 came and picked me up an hour after @PERSON1 and I walked back to her house. She came and got me, and asked me ""@CAPS17 was it? Did you have fun?"" All I said to @CAPS21 @CAPS5 was, ""@CAPS19 @CAPS5. I had the time of @CAPS21 life.

84,21749,8,"I love the mall. I've loved it from the first time I've been in one, and it has always been on my mental things-I-want-to-do-list. I remember clearly enough only one time I've laughed until I cried and beyond: it was one of the times I was in the mall.I was eight, maybe nine, and I was with my big sister by one of those wishing wells you supposedly toss a coin in, then watch it circle down until it reaches the hole - I still don't know what they're called. My sister was tossing coins in when two other girls came along and started chatting. We said this and that about the wishing well, the two strangers were tossing coins in too, trying to get them to circle the well just right. Trying but not succeeding. In the midst of it, along came a man who was curious about what we were doing. He tried to flip his coins in just right, too, but he did even worse than we did. His coins didn't even make it to the hole. He gave up and walked away. Then the funny part came. We girls started chatting again when one of them suddenly thought she should return the man his wasted jingle change. She grabbed it and chased after him. ""@CAPS1, you forgot your money!"" she called out in her high-pitched little-girly voice; ""@CAPS2! @CAPS1! @CAPS1! You forgot your money!"" All the people in sight turned around and looked at her as she made her sharade. Some took second glances and some kept staring. I started laughing. Look at her chasing after him, making that commotion, over the insignificant coins he didn't want! Look at the cute, ridiculous spectacle she's making! She put the money in the man's hand. I laughed harder. People switched stares and glances from me to her. My embarrassed sister tried to get me to shut up, but I only laughed the more. As the girl returned and saw me holding on to the well with tears streaming down my face, laughing my brains out, her face changed. She realized only then she had done something embarrassing. I laughed even harder. My sister tried to convince the girl that it wasn't a big deal as I kept on laughing. They made strained apologies to each other. The two girls were gone the next minute.

I've loved it from the first time I've been in one, and it has always been on my mental things-I-want-to-do-list. I remember clearly enough only one time I've laughed until I cried and beyond: it was one of the times I was in the mall.I was eight, maybe nine, and I was with my big sister by one of those wishing wells you supposedly toss a coin in, then watch it circle down until it reaches the hole - I still don't know what they're called. My sister was tossing coins in when two other girls came along and started chatting. We said this and that about the wishing well, the two strangers were tossing coins in too, trying to get them to circle the well just right. Trying but not succeeding. In the midst of it, along came a man who was curious about what we were doing. He tried to flip his coins in just right, too, but he did even worse than we did. His coins didn't even make it to the hole. He gave up and walked away. Then the funny part came. We girls started chatting again when one of them suddenly thought she should return the man his wasted jingle change. She grabbed it and chased after him. ""@CAPS1, you forgot your money!"" she called out in her high-pitched little-girly voice; ""@CAPS2! @CAPS1! @CAPS1! You forgot your money!"" All the people in sight turned around and looked at her as she made her sharade. Some took second glances and some kept staring. I started laughing. Look at her chasing after him, making that commotion, over the insignificant coins he didn't want! Look at the cute, ridiculous spectacle she's making! She put the money in the man's hand. I laughed harder. People switched stares and glances from me to her. My embarrassed sister tried to get me to shut up, but I only laughed the more. As the girl returned and saw me holding on to the well with tears streaming down my face, laughing my brains out, her face changed. She realized only then she had done something embarrassing. I laughed even harder. My sister tried to convince the girl that it wasn't a big deal as I kept on laughing. They made strained apologies to each other. The two girls were gone the next minute. I continued having bursts of laughter. For the rest of the day, I thought back to that scene by the wishing well and laugh out loud, out of the blue.

87,21754,8,"Laughter is a big part of life. A lot of people look at you how much you laugh in life cause it place a part in your life every day. Some people say they never laugh, I think that is crazy cause if you never laugh how will you enjoy life. There are so many people that say that I laugh to much I always say you can never laugh to much it to good for you. there are so many story's that I could tell you but I think I have the best one on my mind. It is the time I went to the park with my friends on a @DATE2 @TIME1.It all started on a @DATE2 @TIME1 I was at the park with my friends and I. we were all just playing catch with the football and out of no were one of my friends want out for a pass and ran right into a swing and fall straight on his face it was the funnest thing I have ever seen. I was on the ground for like @NUM1 min laughing. we tolled everyone at the school cause one of my friends filmed it so we watch it over and over and over again. That why I think laughing plays such a big part in your life cause it helps people get to know the real you and it makes laugh so much more fun. That's why laughing is so much fun I mean that's why I cant see why people don't like to laugh cause it is the biggest part in my life and I always use it. I use laughing like a second voice. I wouldn't enjoy live if @CAPS1't laugh cause it would be like being a robot and that sounds dumb but back to a neither story I am going to talk about when i was snowboarding with @PERSON1.It was on the @DATE1 up at @CAPS2.Hood @PERSON1 and I were going snowboarding. we were just doing some runs and some simple tricks and we stop for lunch. after lunch we went back and the first run @PERSON1 said lets go to the top so I said @CAPS3. So we were on the lift to the top and when we got to the top it was a lot higher then we thought but we still went down. About half way down I trued to hit a jump and I did a @NUM2 and landed straight on my face so I look up and @PERSON1 laughing at me and I looked up again and trying was laughing so hard at me he didn't see the tree in front of me and run right into it. I was laughing so hard he was saying it was my fault cause I crushed so he did but ones we were at the bottom we went back in side and we were laughing at either for what just happen and how we were the best in are grade and we just sucked.

I was excited to meet someone from a place I had always dreamed of going, and practice my @CAPS1 with a native @CAPS1 speaker for the first time. When we arrived at the meeting place, the orientation with the coordinator was still in session. As we waited outside, thoughts were running through my head. What does she look like? Will she like our family? The time had come to meet our exchange student for the first time, and all of my thoughts had settled. Within minutes, @PERSON1 was in our family's car, and with us on our way home. When we arrived home, I showed @PERSON1 around the house to make her feel welcomed and comfortable. Not too long afterward, @PERSON1 and I were talking about anything that came to mind. It made me feel like I had a sister for the first time. Sadly, there was a minor language barrier between the two of us but her laughter completed all her thoughts. Her laughter made me feel like she liked me as a host sister and made her stay more fun for her and I. During @PERSON1's stay, I devoted more time to her than to my school work. We played board games and card games each night but they were all at home. I felt like it made her experience boring and incomplete. On @DATE1, the day before her departure, I took her souvenir shopping. It was a jaunt to the mall to shop for her family and experience another part of town. @PERSON1 and I were excited to spend a nice day together and end her trip in an unforgettable way. Our first stop at the mall was @CAPS3-a-@CAPS4 @CAPS5. I had told @PERSON1 about it and she was very excited to @CAPS3 bears for her family. She had never seen anything like it. We started off by picking out a @CAPS4, then we stuffed it, picked out clothes for it, and we gave it a name and made a birth certificate for it. We continued roaming the mall when we finished, but could not find anything too unique or not available in @LOCATION2. Our last stop was @CAPS6 to shop for @CAPS7 snacks. During her stay, I had introduced her to a lot of @CAPS7 foods like granola bars and fruit snack, she liked them and wanted to take them home for brother and little cousins. When we were done, we got on the subway and headed home. My mom was not at the subway station when we got there, so we continued shopping. We walked into an accessories store that was loaded with earrings and necklaces and many other girly items. @PERSON1 and I spotted a section that had friendship necklaces. There was a necklace that said best friends with two roller skates. Roller skating was perhaps the most fun thing she got to experience in @LOCATION1 and it was a great bonding experience for the two of us. Without hesitation, we bought the necklaces and wore it to symbolize our lasting friendship.  That night, after shopping for the whole day, our family took @PERSON1 out for her last dinner in @LOCATION1. Every night, my parents had prepared @CAPS9 food which was relatively close to @CAPS1 food, so when we went out for @CAPS11 food that night, it was the first time @PERSON1 had tried something rather foreign. @PERSON1 told us that the @CAPS11 food in @LOCATION1 tasted different but better than the @CAPS11 food in @LOCATION2. She told us that she really enjoyed the stay and was very grateful for meeting our family. These words made me even more dreadful of @DATE2, the day that she would be fly back to @LOCATION2 and be with her real family. The day we had to say our goodbyes.

Cameras were rapidly flashing and my mouth was was hurting from the constant smiling we were doing to capture our last memories. I stayed at the airport for as long as I possibly could and every last moment I spent with her seemed more and more emotional. I had met @PERSON1 just a week ago but I created such a close bond with her that I did not want her to leave. She was like my best friend that knew everything about me and brought me so much joy. I could not help but let out the tears I was trying so hard to hold back. When she entered into security I remember the feeling I had. I didn't know when I was going to see her again, or what our future was going to hold. I had a great time with her and I hope that she felt the same way.

I was scared that school would be hard and that I would be all by myself and that I wouldn't have any @CAPS4 but I would later learn I was very wrong. I never would imagine @PERSON3, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 would become @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 that I couldn't live without. You'll understand better if i tell you the story of how we became @CAPS3 @CAPS4. We all had are first @CAPS1 classes together and I guess that's where we bonded. @PERSON3 and I had gone to school together the previous year but we weren't much of friend seeing as we hated each other with a passion. Later I found out that we really had nothing to hate each other for so it wasn't that hard to win her over. My first impression of @PERSON1 that was she would be preppy and I pushed her away but then she grew on me. She wasn't that super fecal person I thought she would be and when I got to know her she had her ups and downs but she was really cool. Last but not least @PERSON2, at first she was really annoying. I mean really annoying she never stopped talking but after a few weeks she was really fun to talk to. All @CAPS1 of these relationships grew stronger and stronger through laughter and just plain out there fun! We started hanging out and going to school dances together. A week before the homecoming dance I got sick and I wasn't able to go but my @CAPS4 were still worried about me and that felt good to have someone worry about me and I was glad these girls became my @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Then on my @NUM1 birthday I had a big party and not many people came but they did and that night every single one of them called me at mid-night saying happy birthday at that moment I new that we would be @CAPS4 forever and nothing would come between us. That we would be able to go through the hardest times and over come them. Then when the fun times come we would be wild and laugh tell we couldn't anymore. I am glad to call these girls my @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Sometimes they get on my nerves and make me mad but I know that they will be here for me know matter what happens. Through all those good times and bad times I will have @CAPS1 great people in my life forever and I'm glad that they happened.

91,21758,8," Being happy is an important part of any relationship. It is something that is found individually and brought to the relationship to be shared. After discovering happiness alone, a relationship can start to develop and the happiness can be shared. This most often happens in the form of laughter.  Laughter truly has an influence on a relationship but it expands to even deeper key elements that lead to success of a relationship. Like I stated before joy, or happiness, is important in any and all relationships. However, I don't mean just being happy when you are with that person and not being able to find it within life on your own; it actually means being able to enjoy life individually without depending on another human to satisfy you. If happiness isn't found individually how can you expect someone else to make you happy? Utter joy is found on your own in the little things life has to offer like a smile, a laugh, or a beautiful day.  When the initiative has been taken to be happy with yourself then it can be shared with others. This is were laughter and happiness join hand-in-hand! Joy is displayed through two main expressions first through a smile, secondly through laughing. Hearing a significant other laugh or seeing them smile gives the feeling of happiness. Laughter has the ability to lighten the mood as well as calm a tense situation. Although a relationship without laughter can lead to tense, sad, or even uncomfortable situations leaving both involved unhappy.  From my own personal experience with relationships I have come to learn that laughter is a key element to the development of a strong bond between two people. I learned this lesson in the midst of personal struggles to build bonds with two very important people. With the first one I had spent three years struggling to cooperate with, though the other I spent six months trying to find a flaw in. Where the first relationship failed was the fact that neither of us had the ability to cheer the other. Together we thought that being alone was sad or lonely, and if we were together we could make each other happy. The truth is we were totally wrong in both aspects, first in thinking happiness was found in each other as well as not having the ability to express our happiness with one another. Throughout the second relationship, @PERSON2 and I, met on the idea life was exciting, both care free and satisfied with where we were. It wasn't hard to laugh, in fact both of us were very humorous bright people! Our bond was created through our sense of humor and our love for laughter. As time passed our joy brought us closer and closer, it has also helped us overcome obstacles we have stumbled through along the way.  Due to the ability to share laughter and joy, @PERSON2 and I have a connection that has built itself, of course it has ups and downs but since those downs can easily be resolved, the relationship is lasting. Along with building bonds and keeping them together laughter can make you feel closer to those you love. I believe this is the very best part of laughter. When distant from those important life can get lonely. Although being able to call someone you left and share a little piece of joy with them can make a bad day turn completely upside down. Then that feeling inside that was once sad and lonely now feels warm and less empty. I have moved several times throughout high school, and the hardest move I ever made was recently when moved to @PERSON1. I left a lot of my friends, mentors, family and @PERSON2. Coming to a new place I felt alone, I was not surrounded by familiar people, and I extremely missed the time I lost with @PERSON2. What helped me most during the transition was being able to call him and though we missed each other sharing a happy conversation seemed to make things better. When we would talk often times we were able to share laughter through old memories or new ones. The laughter my @PERSON2 and I were able to share had the ability to make us feel no so far apart! More importantly because of laughter we were able to stay close, and I had someone there for me during the new changes I encountered. Laughter is a extraordinary part of life, without out laughter many things would be lost like fun, joy, humor and happiness; if not lost they wouldn't be as they are now. For me, laughter has been an extremely important part of my life, there are many struggles with relationships and life I couldn't have overcame without that piece of joy it was able to provide. To me without laughter there would be no point to live because there would be now joy in life. Laughter is a powerful tool, it really does make the world a better place.

92,21761,8,"                                    Warm Laughter   I think everyone have to laughter, and everyone hear laughter. What is laughter? The question looks easy. But, the question has many answers. Everyone has the answer for myself. Someone said: laughter is the shortest distance between two people. Someone thought laughter is the best form of communication between humans. Moreover, I thought the laughter like the sun, and it can melt ice of human's heart.   I want to tell a true story about my class. when I was @NUM1 years old. I studied in middle school my class had @NUM2 people.(In @LOCATION1, every class had many people. we didn't move the class.) I remembered in my class had one student. His name was @CAPS1. @CAPS2 studied very hard. @CAPS2 always take a good grade in testes. Every teacher thought @CAPS2 was a good student. But, many students didn't like him below me. Because @CAPS2 often snitch. Whenever @CAPS2 saw student copy each other. @CAPS2 talked to teacher immediately. We hated him. But, we thought @CAPS2 is a brave boy after @CAPS2 do one even.   Remembered this even happen when we left class. My friends and I played the table tennis in school. We played very happily. But in this time, I used big strength hitting the ball. The ball through the table hit one man. I saw @CAPS2 was very tall and strong. I thought @CAPS2 was a high school student. @CAPS2 was very angry. @CAPS2 told loudly:"" shut, whose ball hit me."" @CAPS2 saw us. @CAPS2 walked slowly to us. So, we was very afraid.   @CAPS2 asked us:"" @CAPS3 hit me."" We didn't talk anything. ""@CAPS3"" @CAPS2 asked again. I said ""me"". @CAPS2 look me. @CAPS2 lifted his arm. I closed my eyes. ""stop"" one boy said. I open the eyes. I saw @CAPS1. @CAPS2 was in front of me. Th man punch him in the face. ""@CAPS5 you punch me"" @CAPS1 asked. The man said:"" I don't want to punch you and I want to punch the student behind your. "" @CAPS5 you punch him and @CAPS2 is my friend. @CAPS1 said. The man said:"" @CAPS2 used his ball hit me. I said:"" sorry, I am not carefully. "" @CAPS2 already said sorry. Can you return his ball? if you don't return his ball, I talked to you teacher. I know you are form @NUM3 grade. The man said:"" @CAPS9, no problem. At then, the man used the big strength threw the ball hit @CAPS1's heat. @CAPS1 get hurt. But, @CAPS1 didn't talk anything. @CAPS2 just look the man all the time. The man said:"" you are good. the man go away. ""@CAPS12, it's hurt.@CAPS1 said. I said:"" are you @CAPS9, I am sorry. @CAPS1 laughed to me said:"" I am good. Don't worry. You played ball carefully. I said:""yes, thank you. @CAPS1 said:"" see you, I will go home. You go home early. You mother worry you. I said:"" see you. @CAPS1 go home. I thought his laughter is very warm. The laughter like the sun through mu heart. @CAPS2 is a really good man. So, after the even happened @CAPS2 was be my friend best.   laughter is the most nice sounds in the world.

94,21763,8," If you're @CAPS11 me you're the type of person that laughs at the dumbest jokes or the simplest things in life, I believe laughter is an important part of any relationship.Don't you hate that feeling when you laugh and you think you're going to pee yourself because your laughing too hard or you find something extremely funny? Well I do, I've peed myself once because I was laughing too hard and I couldn't manage to hold @CAPS14 in. @CAPS14 was my brother's @NUM1 @CAPS5 party, I still remember this @CAPS11 if @CAPS14 were yesterday.               @CAPS14 was about a week before my brother's @CAPS5 so my parents and I decided that we would surprise him with a @CAPS5 party. His @CAPS5 wasn't going to be anything big just me my parents and my younger siblings.My mom had planned that she would go to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 after work to buy him chocolate ice cream cake something he would definitely enjoy, balloons and a @CAPS3 set. Those were his favorite kind of toys which he had millions of! I agreed with her and told her that I would make dinner since she would be home later than usual. I decided that I would cook @PERSON1's all time favorite dinner @CAPS4. @CAPS14 was an easy meal to make so I thought we should spoil him since @CAPS14 was his @CAPS5. But he had no idea he would get more than he expected.        A week had past @CAPS14 was @DATE1. I ran into my brothers room and woke him up ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5 @PERSON1!"" I yelled early in the morning @CAPS14 was about six fifteen a.m. He looked annoyed and still half asleep all he said was ""@CAPS7 @CAPS10,"" and told me to get out and went back to sleep. I was a little disappointed thinking maybe he would be more enthusiastic since @CAPS14 was his @CAPS5, I think I was more excited than he was. We had school that day so I got ready and went off to school. After a long exhausting day of school, I went home to an empty house, no one was home yet and my parents were working. My siblings were all in elementary school so they got out a little later than I did. I sat in the living room looking out the window and waited for my sister and my brothers to come home. Once they were all off the bus I opened the door @PERSON2,@CAPS8 and @CAPS9 barged in through the house yelling ""@CAPS10 wer're homeeee!"" @CAPS11 I hadn't noticed. Once @PERSON1 was inside I gave him a hug and again told him @CAPS6 @CAPS5. I was curious so I asked him ""@CAPS13 was your day?"" in my motherly voice. ""@CAPS14 was good, my teachers and friends sang @CAPS6 @CAPS5 to me during lunch, I also got a chocolate cupcake,"" he said in a joyful voice. After that he went off to his room, and I went off into the kitchen to cook dinner for all of us. I was excited I wanted that chocolate ice cream cake and I couldn't wait.       After dinner I had to wash the dishes and clean up the mess. Once I was done with the dishes I got the cake out of the refrigerator and set @CAPS14 on the table. Everyone was to occupied to even notice what we were doing. Once the candles were placed around the cake, my mother told the kids to come to the dining room. @PERSON1 obviously hadn't heard because he was the last one to come. When he was coming from the hallway we all yelled ""surprise!"" his face looked shocked and you could tell he was @CAPS6. All the kids had sat down except for me my mom, my dad and @PERSON1 we were the only ones standing surrounding the cake. I was to the left of my brother my dad was behind him and my mom was to his right. My brother was about to sit down but right when he was going to sit my dad moved the chair to the side and he fell flat on his butt. He didn't do @CAPS14 on purpose he was just trying to move @CAPS14 so my brother could blow the candles.@CAPS14 was hilarious we all started laughing, I laughed so hard i peed myself I was on the floor rolling. After that my brother started laughing at me his face was red @CAPS11 a tomato. I was so embarrassed I couldn't believe what had happened.    My parents were also laughing @CAPS14 was just a family moment we didn't get to see as often. I mean @CAPS14 was nice to know that, that experience brought all of us a memorable experience and a lot of laughter.

96,21765,8," Laughing with my @CAPS1    @CAPS2 was a hot @DATE1 day in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. My @CAPS1 and I just got done eating a scrumptious flieschkegla lunch. I asked her if she wanted to go down and play a game of baseball on the @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1. My @CAPS1 said that she would love to. As we got down in to the chilled basement, we felt a cool breeze that soothed our skin because of how blistering hot @CAPS2 was on that day. We sat down on the rough carpet and started to play.  We chose our teams, she was the @LOCATION1 and I was the @ORGANIZATION1 because those were our favorite teams. We started the game, and my @CAPS1 didn't know how to play, so I had to teach her everything. Every time she would do something wrong we would start laughing because we thought @CAPS2 was very funny that she couldn't do anything right. She would try to throw to first base, but she would push the button that made the player throw to third, so I would keep running around the bases until I scored. This made us laugh very, very hard because she couldn't get me out, except when I helped her. Eventually, my mom came in to record all of this because my @CAPS1 and I couldn't stop laughing, and if we did stop laughing @CAPS2 wasn't for very long before we started up again.  Then after we played about five innings of the nine inning game the most amusing part of this whole game happened. I hit the ball into the outfield and @CAPS2 hit the wall. As my @CAPS1 went to go throw @CAPS2 in, I was already around the bases. Once she got the ball in, she got @CAPS2 to the pitcher and he ran to the dugout, and she couldn't get out of there. @CAPS2 took her about five to ten minutes to get out, and through that whole time we were laughing! We made jokes about how the manager was telling his pitcher to do better than he was because he was pitching so bad, and how he was too scared to get back on the mound because of his dreadful pitching. The laughter of just us two carried through the house. Even after the funniest part of the game, the laughter continued through the remainder of the baseball game.     After we were done playing, I told her I thought that she had played like a @CAPS1. She thought that that was hilarious and with the sound of her laughter, I couldn't help myself but to brake out laughing. My @CAPS1 had this unique laugh through the whole game that always sparked something in my funny bone that made me laugh.  Throughout the rest of the time that I was at my @CAPS1's house, when someone would bring up baseball or playing @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1, my @CAPS1 and I would laugh and laugh until @CAPS2 hurt. I would also joke about wanting to play her again and she would then let out a rotund laugh that would make me fall into a laughing trance.  After this day, I have always felt different about how I thought of my @CAPS1. I always thought that she was a very generous and nice person with a great attitude, but I never thought that she was as smiley and giggly as she was on that day. I now know that I can make jokes with her and that she can make jokes with me because we can both laugh at our mistakes. The biggest thing that I can take from this event is that I will always remember my @CAPS1 for her laughter, and even after she passes away from our world, I can know that she is laughing at me and with me, up in heaven.

Few minutes after we got on our bikes and headed out to the river. It took us @NUM1 minutes to get to the river. Once we got there we sat down on the edge of the river on the bank. ""say I wonder if there are any crawdads around."" said @PERSON3. I pondered the comment for a minute. ""I don't know,"" I said, "" probably not yet."" For the next five minutes nothing but silence, until I flicked my lighter to light my smoke. ""@CAPS1 I'm going in,"" @PERSON3 said, ""come in when your done smoking..."" ""@CAPS7,"" I said, "" why don't I just come in also, we can go to @ORGANIZATION1 and float down back to here."" @PERSON3 laughs, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS10 sounds good."" We then walked across the river to get to this area that is crowded with over growth of bushes at least fifteen feet high. Whats funny when we @CAPS17 this while sneaking to @ORGANIZATION1 is that we were in military fatigues. They got wet but, @CAPS11 @CAPS1, we do this a lot @CAPS4 we didn't care. We got to @ORGANIZATION1 quickly running and laughing. Because we thought we were at @LOCATION1, running from dogs. @CAPS11 @CAPS4 much fun. I took off my fatigues and set them out to dry and changed into my swim trunks, lit up another cigarette. ""@CAPS2, that was close lieutenant."" I said. ""@CAPS10,"" @PERSON3 chuckled, ""we forgot the drinks the float back down."" ""@CAPS11 crud!"" I said,""@CAPS12 on our six!"" we jumped into the water. Me doing a cannon ball, and @PERSON3 doing some weird @CAPS13 dive from the cliff. ""@CAPS14 off."" We both said at the same @CAPS15. the sun was setting we arrived back at our beach side by the river. ""@CAPS15 to go back i suppose."" I said. ""I agree."" @PERSON3 said. @CAPS4 we sat for a few minutes and drank a few energy drinks and got dressed. ""We need to get the fatigues."" I said. ""I'll go,"" @PERSON3 said, ""and you go to the bikes and wait I'll be there in five."" @CAPS4 we split up, I went to the bikes and @CAPS5 went to the fatigues. We had a good @CAPS15 riding back to his house, laughing all the way back. ""@CAPS17 you see the looks on thoughs @CAPS18 faces when we came out of the bushes?"" I asked. @PERSON3 laughed, ""@CAPS10, that was hella funny they were like, '@CAPS11 @CAPS21!'.""

99,21768,8," I tapped @CAPS4 foot nervously as the comedian stepped down from the stage. The audience's applause was strong but brief--more polite than appreciative. I use the term ""audience"" loosely, as at least four fifths of the people who were sitting before the stage were also comedians. Only five people were brave enough to show up without any intent of participating themselves. At that moment, all I could think about was how much I wished I was one of them, but I wasn't. I had to perform. The comedian was replaced by the announcer, and @CAPS4 foot's tapping became a relentless pounding. Looking back, I didn't really have a reason to be as distressed as I was. The audience was sparse at best, and they couldn't have had high expectations. If they had, why would they have come to an open-mic on the seventh floor of a public service building? I knew all this at the time, but knowing didn't diminish @CAPS4 anxiety. Stage fright is an irrational, primal fear, and such fears rarely yield to logic. Thus @CAPS4 panic swelled, even as the announcer called me to the stage. Then it happened. Shortly after ascending the stage, I became aware of the announcer's silence. The audience was focused on me; I was expected to speak. In that instant I forgot everything I had memorized. The routine I had so diligently practiced over the past few days completely fled @CAPS4 mind. It hadn't been a very good routine, but it had been something to hold onto. Now it was gone. The audience wanted something from me that I no longer had.  @CAPS4 brain scrambled for leverage, for anything that could be used to extricate myself from the situation I had found myself in. The microphone! It was still on the stand. I slowly took the microphone into @CAPS4 hands and deliberately set the stand aside. However that only bought me a few seconds; I needed to do better than that. Searching deeper, @CAPS4 brain turned to @CAPS4 comedy education. @CAPS4 education, like @CAPS4 routine, had been brief and unspectacular. However a few key things stuck out, among them one of the very first things I had learned. ""All comedy stems from negative opinion,"" @CAPS4 teacher had constantly repeated during our private lessons. ""All @CAPS1 gotta do in stand-up is complain."" That was it. I had found @CAPS4 way out. Immediately, I put on an indignant voice and began to speak. ""@CAPS1 know what I hate most?"" I demanded, even as I struggled to find the answer myself. However @CAPS4 brain was gaining momentum, it was no longer frozen as it had been a few moments ago. I realized that the announcer had miss-pronounced @CAPS4 last name. Choosing this fact as the thing I detested most in the world, I sneered, ""@CAPS2 people say @CAPS3-man!"" I don't know why, maybe it was because @CAPS4 relatively young voice sounded funny, or perhaps it was because I had packed those four words with such condescension. For whatever reason, the audience laughed. ""@CAPS4 last name is @CAPS5,"" I cried with outrage, emboldened by this new-found encouragement. I proceeded to rebuke the announcer for his grave error and even went so far as to denounce all of the people in the world who couldn't be bothered to pronounce people's names correctly. Once again, @CAPS4 ludicrous rant was met with laughter. Upon hearing this laughter, I realized I had already succeeded. If the audience would laugh at @CAPS4 crudely improvised remarks, surely they would do the same for @CAPS4 meticulously crafted jokes. With this reassurance in mind, @CAPS4 preparations came back to me as if I had never forgotten them. @CAPS4 confidence renewed, I told everything from the beginning. I launched into a criticism of @LOCATION1's polluted sky and crowed streets. Yet the audience wasn't interested in the content of @CAPS4 presentation. They were interested in the loud, indignant kid before them who stubbornly refused to let anything satisfy him.  I continued to play the part I had created for myself with increasing enthusiasm. Yet before I had even gotten through half @CAPS4 material, the red light turned on. I had one minute left to finish. Rather than struggling to fill @CAPS4 five minutes of time as I had anticipated, I instead found myself with much more to say. I had created an engrossing dialogue with the audience that was every bit as hard to break away from as an actual conversation. Nevertheless, I made only a few snide comments before returning the microphone. As I started to step down from the stage, I was surprised to be met with a sizable applause. It was the loudest shout the audience had produced all night, though the acoustics of the stage @MONTH1 have influenced its volume.

The audience's applause was strong but brief--more polite than appreciative. I use the term ""audience"" loosely, as at least four fifths of the people who were sitting before the stage were also comedians. Only five people were brave enough to show up without any intent of participating themselves. At that moment, all I could think about was how much I wished I was one of them, but I wasn't. I had to perform. The comedian was replaced by the announcer, and @CAPS4 foot's tapping became a relentless pounding. Looking back, I didn't really have a reason to be as distressed as I was. The audience was sparse at best, and they couldn't have had high expectations. If they had, why would they have come to an open-mic on the seventh floor of a public service building? I knew all this at the time, but knowing didn't diminish @CAPS4 anxiety. Stage fright is an irrational, primal fear, and such fears rarely yield to logic. Thus @CAPS4 panic swelled, even as the announcer called me to the stage. Then it happened. Shortly after ascending the stage, I became aware of the announcer's silence. The audience was focused on me; I was expected to speak. In that instant I forgot everything I had memorized. The routine I had so diligently practiced over the past few days completely fled @CAPS4 mind. It hadn't been a very good routine, but it had been something to hold onto. Now it was gone. The audience wanted something from me that I no longer had. @CAPS4 brain scrambled for leverage, for anything that could be used to extricate myself from the situation I had found myself in. The microphone! It was still on the stand. I slowly took the microphone into @CAPS4 hands and deliberately set the stand aside. However that only bought me a few seconds; I needed to do better than that. Searching deeper, @CAPS4 brain turned to @CAPS4 comedy education. @CAPS4 education, like @CAPS4 routine, had been brief and unspectacular. However a few key things stuck out, among them one of the very first things I had learned. ""All comedy stems from negative opinion,"" @CAPS4 teacher had constantly repeated during our private lessons. ""All @CAPS1 gotta do in stand-up is complain."" That was it. I had found @CAPS4 way out. Immediately, I put on an indignant voice and began to speak. ""@CAPS1 know what I hate most?"" I demanded, even as I struggled to find the answer myself. However @CAPS4 brain was gaining momentum, it was no longer frozen as it had been a few moments ago. I realized that the announcer had miss-pronounced @CAPS4 last name. Choosing this fact as the thing I detested most in the world, I sneered, ""@CAPS2 people say @CAPS3-man!"" I don't know why, maybe it was because @CAPS4 relatively young voice sounded funny, or perhaps it was because I had packed those four words with such condescension. For whatever reason, the audience laughed. ""@CAPS4 last name is @CAPS5,"" I cried with outrage, emboldened by this new-found encouragement. I proceeded to rebuke the announcer for his grave error and even went so far as to denounce all of the people in the world who couldn't be bothered to pronounce people's names correctly. Once again, @CAPS4 ludicrous rant was met with laughter. Upon hearing this laughter, I realized I had already succeeded. If the audience would laugh at @CAPS4 crudely improvised remarks, surely they would do the same for @CAPS4 meticulously crafted jokes. With this reassurance in mind, @CAPS4 preparations came back to me as if I had never forgotten them. @CAPS4 confidence renewed, I told everything from the beginning. I launched into a criticism of @LOCATION1's polluted sky and crowed streets. Yet the audience wasn't interested in the content of @CAPS4 presentation. They were interested in the loud, indignant kid before them who stubbornly refused to let anything satisfy him. I continued to play the part I had created for myself with increasing enthusiasm. Yet before I had even gotten through half @CAPS4 material, the red light turned on. I had one minute left to finish. Rather than struggling to fill @CAPS4 five minutes of time as I had anticipated, I instead found myself with much more to say. I had created an engrossing dialogue with the audience that was every bit as hard to break away from as an actual conversation. Nevertheless, I made only a few snide comments before returning the microphone. As I started to step down from the stage, I was surprised to be met with a sizable applause. It was the loudest shout the audience had produced all night, though the acoustics of the stage @MONTH1 have influenced its volume. It was quite clear that the audience had found what they were looking for in me, and I found myself remembering @CAPS4 teacher's words once again.

When i got down the hill all i was thinking was how are we supposed to get back up that? A few minutes later we finally reached our destination. I was hot and sweat and ready to swim. I took of my shirt and set my bag down. I walked over to where @PERSON1 was and looked down at the water. At least @NUM1 feet i was thinking, @CAPS2 what i said was ""@CAPS3 this is nothing""""@CAPS4 gets better"" @PERSON1 replied @CAPS5 pointed up to this tree that had a very rigid board nailed onto some branches that appeared to be a support structure for someone to stand on. I was not planning on jumping off of this wooden plank, @CAPS2 then when @PERSON1 did @CAPS4 i was hoping maybe @CAPS4's not so terrifying when your actually up there. I was blatantly wrong every time i looked down at the water @CAPS4 seems as if i were to jump and never hit the ground. I couldn't be a coward and get down so i figured the only way to get down was to by just leaping off bravely. I counted to three and right as i got to three i stepped forward to leap off and i could feel the warm breeze on my face and the adrenaline pumping through my veins. Before i knew @CAPS4 i hit the water and all those heroic and amazing feelings quickly turned to pain and regret. I had managed to land partially on my back. We got out of the water and @PERSON1 saw my back and said ""@CAPS7 your back is so red!"" I was in a lot of pain @CAPS2 through all this pain @CAPS4 was still so much fun while @CAPS4 lasted and we had a good laugh about @CAPS4 all. Next up was the rapids. We decided to go down these feet first. The water moves very fast so @CAPS4 carries you like you are a tiny leaf. There was rocks that stuck out of the water that we tried to avoid and there were some rocks hidden below the water that we wish we would have avoided. @CAPS4 was so fun @CAPS2 there was also a lot of pain involved. The entire time we were looking over at each other just abrupt in laughter. Once we got down all the rapids there was a miniature waterfall we swam over to this waterfall and climbed to the top took a seat right on top and just started talking about the day. When we first arrived i thought this was a bad idea coming and i wished i would have made an excuse and not came. After all the hiking and all the troubles getting there when we finally arrived at the cliffs i was scared to jump off, @CAPS2 one reason why me and @PERSON1 are such good friends is because we aren't afraid to take risks to have a good time. Sometimes this lands us in a lot of trouble though! In this case we took the risk to throw our bodies off and could seriously injure ourselves just for the laugh and the thrilling experience. Laughter and excitement don't come from sitting on the couch watching @CAPS9 @CAPS4 comes from going out and trying new things and having a good time.

We laughed a lot over something that seems so boring and something that wouldn't be funny to most. But that is what true laughter is when you are with somebody, and something so little can seem funny. When @PERSON1 came over, we were board, finally we found something to do, then we laughed, and laughed and laughed.

So then we continued to throw the ball at the, fan to see where it would go and what it would hit. Even though this seems boring we now had something to do.  We continued to throw the ball at the fan. Then after a while we started to throw more and more stuff at the fan. We threw everything from key chains to sticks of deodorant at the fan.

104,21774,8," My older brother once wanted my mom and I to come up to @LOCATION1 to visit him. We set a date and decided to go in a couple weeks. Preparing for trips took us forever. This trip wasn't like most trips we've taken in the past, we were driving @CAPS10. This was by far going to be the longest drive I had ever been on. What better way to experience @LOCATION1 for the first time right? My mom has always been bad @CAPS7 time. She's the kind of person that people tell the party's at six thirty @CAPS3 its actually at seven. She said we were going to leave the house by ten am, Which in reality meant a lot later then that. We ended up leaving the house after nine pm. Did I mention my mom has terrible eye sight in the dark? I knew then that I had a long night ahead of me. Ten hours @CAPS10 to be exact. My mom and I brought @CAPS6 much stuff for this drive. Being girls that want to pack everything, because you never know what situation your gonna get in made @CAPS1 difficult for us to @CAPS9 fit in the car.  Finally we got in the car and were on our way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1. First we had to stop at the store and get ourselves a bunch of junk food, @CAPS1 wouldn't be a road trip without that. After our little pit stop we were really on our way. I was my moms eyes, @CAPS2 every sign along the way. My mom and I talked for hours. Eventually I fell asleep and @CAPS1 was her job to find her way for a little bit while i caught some sleep. @CAPS3 I had fallen asleep we were almost to @LOCATION2 falls and @CAPS1 was midnight, @CAPS3 i woke up @CAPS1 was two am and we were lost. She thought we were going the right way. We were supposed to be over half way @CAPS10 by now, @CAPS4 we were lost in what looked like a forest. @CAPS1 was actually very frightening being in a forest driving at night @CAPS11 two girls, @CAPS5 since we were seeing no signs at all. We decided maybe we'd use one of our cell phones and get help, @CAPS6 we looked at our phones and @CAPS10 was no cell service. We were starting to get terrified taking every turn we cold find @CAPS11 trying to find some trace of town. I kept telling my mom turn back, @CAPS7 all the turns we had made @CAPS1 wouldn't make a difference @CAPS10 was no way we'd be able to find our way back. This like a bad dream. We continued driving for about another half hour. Then decided maybe if we @CAPS11 pull over and go to sleep till @CAPS1 was light out we would have a better chance of finding our way. Sleeping in a dark forest in a little car is a lot scarier than you @MONTH1 imagine. My mom fell asleep, I was glad about that she deserved the sleep we had been driving for a really long time. While she slept I tried to keep myself occupied, @CAPS7 no cell phone service @CAPS1 was kinda difficult to do. I listened to my ipod for a bit, @CAPS9 then I was bored. @CAPS7 @CAPS1 being @CAPS6 scary out, @CAPS10 was no way i was going to be able to fall asleep. @CAPS9 if I was abnormally tired. @CAPS6 I @CAPS11 sat @CAPS10 and let my mind wander for awhile.  @CAPS1 was finally getting light out, I couldn't be happier. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 got completely light I woke up my mom. We put food in our stomachs and decided we should go for a walk. This place wasn't that scary @CAPS3 @CAPS1 was daytime. We walked for a little bit trying to figure out our surroundings. We started seeing if we could pick up some cell phone reception, For we could get my moms @CAPS12 on her phone to help us. @CAPS3 we got back to the car my mom and I needed to start driving again. We @CAPS11 followed the road we were on for a very long time, @CAPS13 of us knew if we were back tracking or if we were going the right way. After awhile we were on a highway! Then after not long on the highway i saw a location sign @CAPS7 a gas station, We took that exit and we were going to ask for directions. We pulled in to the gas station to see where we were and the man told us we were still in @LOCATION2 falls. If you've ever been to @LOCATION2 falls you'd know its a very tiny town you can drive through the whole town in twenty minutes. The fact we were lost @CAPS6 long was hilarious to my mom and I. We both laughed harder than we had in a long time. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people I believe. That laughter we shared really made us closer.

Finally we got in the car and were on our way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1. First we had to stop at the store and get ourselves a bunch of junk food, @CAPS1 wouldn't be a road trip without that. After our little pit stop we were really on our way. I was my moms eyes, @CAPS2 every sign along the way. My mom and I talked for hours. Eventually I fell asleep and @CAPS1 was her job to find her way for a little bit while i caught some sleep. @CAPS3 I had fallen asleep we were almost to @LOCATION2 falls and @CAPS1 was midnight, @CAPS3 i woke up @CAPS1 was two am and we were lost. She thought we were going the right way. We were supposed to be over half way @CAPS10 by now, @CAPS4 we were lost in what looked like a forest. @CAPS1 was actually very frightening being in a forest driving at night @CAPS11 two girls, @CAPS5 since we were seeing no signs at all. We decided maybe we'd use one of our cell phones and get help, @CAPS6 we looked at our phones and @CAPS10 was no cell service. We were starting to get terrified taking every turn we cold find @CAPS11 trying to find some trace of town. I kept telling my mom turn back, @CAPS7 all the turns we had made @CAPS1 wouldn't make a difference @CAPS10 was no way we'd be able to find our way back. This like a bad dream. We continued driving for about another half hour. Then decided maybe if we @CAPS11 pull over and go to sleep till @CAPS1 was light out we would have a better chance of finding our way. Sleeping in a dark forest in a little car is a lot scarier than you @MONTH1 imagine. My mom fell asleep, I was glad about that she deserved the sleep we had been driving for a really long time. While she slept I tried to keep myself occupied, @CAPS7 no cell phone service @CAPS1 was kinda difficult to do. I listened to my ipod for a bit, @CAPS9 then I was bored. @CAPS7 @CAPS1 being @CAPS6 scary out, @CAPS10 was no way i was going to be able to fall asleep. @CAPS9 if I was abnormally tired. @CAPS6 I @CAPS11 sat @CAPS10 and let my mind wander for awhile. @CAPS1 was finally getting light out, I couldn't be happier. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 got completely light I woke up my mom. We put food in our stomachs and decided we should go for a walk. This place wasn't that scary @CAPS3 @CAPS1 was daytime. We walked for a little bit trying to figure out our surroundings. We started seeing if we could pick up some cell phone reception, For we could get my moms @CAPS12 on her phone to help us. @CAPS3 we got back to the car my mom and I needed to start driving again. We @CAPS11 followed the road we were on for a very long time, @CAPS13 of us knew if we were back tracking or if we were going the right way. After awhile we were on a highway! Then after not long on the highway i saw a location sign @CAPS7 a gas station, We took that exit and we were going to ask for directions. We pulled in to the gas station to see where we were and the man told us we were still in @LOCATION2 falls. If you've ever been to @LOCATION2 falls you'd know its a very tiny town you can drive through the whole town in twenty minutes. The fact we were lost @CAPS6 long was hilarious to my mom and I. We both laughed harder than we had in a long time. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people I believe. That laughter we shared really made us closer.","My older brother once wanted my mom and I to come up to @LOCATION1 to visit him. We set a date and decided to go in a couple weeks. Preparing for trips took us forever. This trip wasn't like most trips we've taken in the past, we were driving @CAPS10. This was by far going to be the longest drive I had ever been on. What better way to experience @LOCATION1 for the first time right? My mom has always been bad @CAPS7 time. She's the kind of person that people tell the party's at six thirty @CAPS3 its actually at seven. She said we were going to leave the house by ten am, Which in reality meant a lot later then that. We ended up leaving the house after nine pm. Did I mention my mom has terrible eye sight in the dark? I knew then that I had a long night ahead of me. Ten hours @CAPS10 to be exact.

106,21777,8," Everybody that I know loves to laugh. They're mostly my boyfriend, my friends, and my family. All my friends and family come together during the @DATE1 and sit around the camp fire. We all look back on the old days and just laugh at all the things that we did. I loved all the stories my mom told about me when I was a little kid because it makes everybody laugh. Even though some of the stories are embarrassing I don't care; I love a good laugh. Plus that's more memories for my friends to remember for the next time we all come together. We try to all come together once a year because were all slowly but surely growing up. So that means were all busy and have no time, but we all try. Some how I always meet new people at the camp fire. Before my boyfriend was in the picture we were just friends. We liked having each others company. When were together we would be laughing most of the time. Our relationship grew each day we spent together. In our relationship laughing is a big element. @CAPS1 was great at telling me jokes to where I would fall to the ground with pain, because by then he knew what I thought was funny. I knew what made @CAPS1 laugh and what he thought was funny too. When every I'm in town with @CAPS1 we always have plans to go see people; either they invited us or when I'm in town. Our friends had told us that they love our company because they're laughing at us or with us. It's all understandable if they laugh at us because we can be a little goofy at times.The one thing that would make he laugh so hard and I just makes me want to hit him; is when i hurt myself and I'm in pain. Instead of helping me and asking if I'm okay he just laugh. For me I just watch him make a mistake. Once he has done that gets mad, hits the something, and then he gets hurt. That right there makes me laugh because his a hot head. When it's time to go see my friends I'm more close to them then @CAPS1 because we have awesome memories. I have several close friends back home and I still keep in touch with them. My old friends and I get so loud around the camp fire just catching up. When @CAPS1 hears all of us laughing he feels felt out because he has no idea what we're talking about. I know he wants to be part of the group. I mean I would probably feel the same if he was laughing with his friends and I had no idea why. I know that I wouldn't like it and just act immature about the situation. So I would call him to come and join us so my girlfriend can tell him why were laughing so hard. As I step back and look at his face I feel good. Just looking at him smiling and being part of the group makes me feel like I'm floating in clouds.  On the other hand laughing is the biggest element in my family. We all like having a good time especially when were all camping. The kind of laughing in my family is laughing at each other. It's kinda wrong, but that's how we are and it's fine with us to a point. If were all camping and there's not a single person talking. My grandma would walk in the middle of the camp fire; look at us and just fart real loud and walk away like nothing had happen. Of course I burst out laughing my lungs out. By me laughing it broke the ice and everyone became chatty. In my moms house you either hear us girls laughing or yelling at each other. My sisters and I have a very special bond. With all my sisters we all have inside jokes with one another. Its great at time because then if there is a disagreement you have someone on your side because of the inside joke. I think that laughter is a big element to any relationship. With your friends you make memories and when you get together you talk about old times. I guarantee you that someone will be laughing. It's a great feeling to laugh with a person. It makes you feel close to that person. With my boyfriend laughter is important to me. Less laughing means to me that there is lots of stress and your not that happy. So without that i would feel incomplete. Laughter is a sense of joy and happiness. It makes everything go easy. When your feeling down and crying; one of your lovely family members will come in and try to make you laugh.

Presently, when I awaken @CAPS2 my slumber there is no sea of animal imprinted blankets to navigate through, as they have been replaced with gold bed sheets. The ritual of the weekends that once enveloped me with happiness has diminished. The hall way that once anticipated a toddler every morning , now only excepts , in annoyance , that there is no longer a weekends ritual ; only a immature teenager passing through every morning, leaving behind the toddler there had once been. All together, the morning bounding has deseaced. All connection has been buried deep within both of us. It seems that laughter is the only action left that can unbury those ""lost"" emotions. Laughter is one emotion father and I share. When father and I laugh for what ever the reason the connection of father and daughter is restored. It makes us feel like we are back to the days where nothing kept us @CAPS2 being us with each other. The scars vanish and all that remains is us; the figure is reviled. It is my daddy. It is as if the autopilot has been turned off and we can regain control of our emotions. This is a time when what I say to him truly comes @CAPS2 within my @CAPS3, but when the moment has passed autopilot switches to ""on"". The silence that once controlled our being has once again sent one of its dark clouds to silence the @CAPS3 of both of us. The vanished scars reappear as open wounds.

I remember from the very beginning of my schooling, children would brag about what their fathers did for a living. Such moments were when I would walk away, afraid to answer any dad related questions. I never knew what to say, I was ashamed of him, the empty hole deep inside me.

A stranger @DATE5 say the day we met was the most monumental day of my life, but that statement would be false. It was not the day I fell for you or the day you said ""I love you"".

The black hole that was deeper than before was starting to fill, and as it did, a light from beneath my skin began to come through. I was shining, glowing. With this new radiance I lost the huge footsteps that had never matched my quaint physique, the rain was a bit warmer and the breeze, a bit softer. Both of us kept that day a secret, locked in our hearts. Yet there is no doubt in my mind that others did not notice, and if they did, nothing was said.

109,21782,8," I can remember back before high school when stress levels were a lot less then they are now. I remember when I could laugh in class for like three minutes straight and not get a detention but those days have come and gone. Now things are more serious and there is not much time for a good laugh anymore. As for me though, heck I'll laugh all I want I'll take those detentions I'll laugh while getting written up and laugh while sitting in detention I always enjoy a good laugh. Though back to the story I'm supposed to tell, I'm going to tell you about one of the funniest times in my life. Although it might not seem funny to some people it was to me and some of my best friends and here it goes. So it was the end of @DATE1 right before high school and I was having a pretty sweet @DATE1. I stayed right here in @LOCATION3 but it was still fun I kick it with my friends all @DATE1 and went to the skate park and @LOCATION1 and all that good stuff. Anyways, close to the end of @DATE1 things were looking pretty sharp and it looked like freshman year was gonna be great. I didn't expect two of my best friends were going to tell me they were moving. It was my two best friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 and I couldn't believe I was losing them. but I wasn't going to let that ruin our @DATE1 though. We decided we were going to celebrate the @DATE2 three weeks and have as much fun as we could before they left and that's what we did. We spent the @DATE2 few weeks going to party's staying out past curfew getting in all kinds of little trouble but we ignored all that trouble we got in cause we were having fun and I know that makes me sound like a bad kid but you'd have to look at it in a little rebellious kids point of view I was just out for some fun, harmless fun. But as the days rolled on it soon grew very close to the end of @DATE1 and our fun grew into more trouble by the time we were down to the @DATE2 I was basically disowned but I didn't care I wanted to have fun and that's exactly what we did. So we continue on with the pursuit of the perfect @DATE1 and partied it up. We even threw a couple of huge party's our selves because I happened to have a lot of money over @DATE1 and they had two empty houses with no one in them. It was one of the best summers I ever had but it ended awkwardly. The @DATE1 before the @DATE1 was the @DATE1 I got to hang with my friends because they were leaving and so that @DATE1 we made the best @DATE1 of @DATE1 we started it at like three o' clock in the @TIME1 and stayed out all @DATE1 having fun going to party's just enjoying the @DATE1. But the night times when it really got interesting we go some fireworks and went around town lighting them off until we got to the store called ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4"" at like @NUM1 in the @TIME1 and we climbed on top of it as one of the @DATE2 things we did. Getting up there actually wasn't that hard but while we were up there the funny stuff happened. We were up there for an hour or two talking bout good memories and raced around the roof top a bit. Though we didn't know that about twenty minutes later we hear a car pull up behind the building and stopped and we peeked over the roof and saw it was a police car and so we freaked out cause we cant run away on a roof. Five minutes later half of @LOCATION2's police force was there and a fire truck and they searched the roof they eventually found us there in the corner and made us climb down the fire truck.When we got to the police station they told us someone called in and said they thought we had a sniper on the roof. But it was all a misunderstanding they realized that when they searched us and the most the found on us was a bag of chips called our parents and as me and my friends sat there we couldn't help but laugh forever cause of how our @DATE2 @DATE1 ended we went out with a bang I guess you could say.

I remember when I could laugh in class for like three minutes straight and not get a detention but those days have come and gone. Now things are more serious and there is not much time for a good laugh anymore. As for me though, heck I'll laugh all I want I'll take those detentions I'll laugh while getting written up and laugh while sitting in detention I always enjoy a good laugh. Though back to the story I'm supposed to tell, I'm going to tell you about one of the funniest times in my life. Although it might not seem funny to some people it was to me and some of my best friends and here it goes. So it was the end of @DATE1 right before high school and I was having a pretty sweet @DATE1. I stayed right here in @LOCATION3 but it was still fun I kick it with my friends all @DATE1 and went to the skate park and @LOCATION1 and all that good stuff. Anyways, close to the end of @DATE1 things were looking pretty sharp and it looked like freshman year was gonna be great. I didn't expect two of my best friends were going to tell me they were moving. It was my two best friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 and I couldn't believe I was losing them. but I wasn't going to let that ruin our @DATE1 though. We decided we were going to celebrate the @DATE2 three weeks and have as much fun as we could before they left and that's what we did. We spent the @DATE2 few weeks going to party's staying out past curfew getting in all kinds of little trouble but we ignored all that trouble we got in cause we were having fun and I know that makes me sound like a bad kid but you'd have to look at it in a little rebellious kids point of view I was just out for some fun, harmless fun. But as the days rolled on it soon grew very close to the end of @DATE1 and our fun grew into more trouble by the time we were down to the @DATE2 I was basically disowned but I didn't care I wanted to have fun and that's exactly what we did. So we continue on with the pursuit of the perfect @DATE1 and partied it up. We even threw a couple of huge party's our selves because I happened to have a lot of money over @DATE1 and they had two empty houses with no one in them. It was one of the best summers I ever had but it ended awkwardly. The @DATE1 before the @DATE1 was the @DATE1 I got to hang with my friends because they were leaving and so that @DATE1 we made the best @DATE1 of @DATE1 we started it at like three o' clock in the @TIME1 and stayed out all @DATE1 having fun going to party's just enjoying the @DATE1. But the night times when it really got interesting we go some fireworks and went around town lighting them off until we got to the store called ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4"" at like @NUM1 in the @TIME1 and we climbed on top of it as one of the @DATE2 things we did. Getting up there actually wasn't that hard but while we were up there the funny stuff happened. We were up there for an hour or two talking bout good memories and raced around the roof top a bit. Though we didn't know that about twenty minutes later we hear a car pull up behind the building and stopped and we peeked over the roof and saw it was a police car and so we freaked out cause we cant run away on a roof. Five minutes later half of @LOCATION2's police force was there and a fire truck and they searched the roof they eventually found us there in the corner and made us climb down the fire truck.When we got to the police station they told us someone called in and said they thought we had a sniper on the roof. But it was all a misunderstanding they realized that when they searched us and the most the found on us was a bag of chips called our parents and as me and my friends sat there we couldn't help but laugh forever cause of how our @DATE2 @DATE1 ended we went out with a bang I guess you could say.

110,21783,8," Laughter is an important part of life, because you don't want to live life all depressed. In my family we love to laugh our butts off, its a way that we know that we're not being uptight or snotty. Some example's to make one another laugh is to tell family stories, make a hilarious joke, or just being yourself and not notice that you did something funny.  First, baby stories or even the telling of a family members memories. Usually @CAPS4's telling the baby stories are the parents or an older sibling's. Then there's the other memories that family members tell about. For instance, my uncle once told about his hunting trip with my dad and my step brother. They were hunting in some kind of valley and all of them were having a couple cans of beer. Then out of nowhere came a white tailed deer. My step brother made the shot and they all thought that they killed the deer, until they were coming up a grade and saw that the deer was starting to stand up in the back of the truck. My step brother was driving the truck and told my dad and uncle to open the widow and smack the deer on the head to knock him out. Neither of them could do so because they were too drunk to reach out and knock out the deer. So my uncle took his gun and made a very lucky shot and got the deer in the head. Then when they came home not one could stop laughing to tell the story of their hunting trip. There's one good story that no one in my family will forget because it's priceless now that a family member from that story is no longer with us.  Second, my family's hilarious joke's but corny @CAPS10. The one member in my family that could tell the best @CAPS10 was my grandfather on my mom's side. @CAPS3 was able to remember all of his @CAPS10 and say some @CAPS10 in the warm springs language. One joke my grandpa told me when i was a little girl was ""@CAPS1 did one tomato say to the other tomato?""... ""@CAPS2!"" @CAPS3 only told me a couple of his @CAPS10 because i was too young to hear his other @CAPS10. But as i got older i heard his other @CAPS10 from my mom, brothers, sisters, and uncle's. Another good person to make @CAPS10 was my dad. They are funny, but they aren't school appropriate. My dad always was telling about his family inside @CAPS10. One that was funny but school appropriate was ""@CAPS4's the best dancer at a @CAPS5 costume party?""... "" The @CAPS6 @CAPS7."" The family got their @CAPS10 either from movies, books, family or friends. The @CAPS6 @CAPS7 joke came from a @CAPS8 of @CAPS10 called The @CAPS8 of @CAPS9 @CAPS10. From that @ORGANIZATION1 movie we made @CAPS10 out of it and resided lines or made @CAPS10 out of those lines.  Last, another way to make each other laugh, was just by being yourself. Like me for instance. I'm always saying ""@CAPS11"" when i can't hear a person talking to me and they'll get mad at me but that doesn't phase me. So the people around us that are able to hear will just laugh at us for having a stupid argument. Or the family will laugh at me because they call me a blond. For example, when someone is telling a joke I'd probably be the last person to get the joke. So they'll laugh at me for being slow at understanding the joke. Or they'll just laugh at anybody @CAPS4's last at understanding the joke. Another way is when a person doesn't do something right, like when they are chopping wood and miss the piece of block, apparently that's funny. Or for no reason my little sister and I will start laughing out of nowhere. Maybe its because we amuse each other or maybe another family member made a funny face. One time my auntie wasn't thinking right and she sat down in a little kid chair that was like a bean bag, and she thought that the chair was a wooden chair. So when she sat down she sank into the bean bag chair and started laughing at her self because she's a blond just like me. Maybe i get my blondness from my auntie.  These are my true stories of time's that make my family. There's the family stories, the hilarious but corny @CAPS10, and there's stories of just being yourself and making a person laugh.

Like me for instance. I'm always saying ""@CAPS11"" when i can't hear a person talking to me and they'll get mad at me but that doesn't phase me. So the people around us that are able to hear will just laugh at us for having a stupid argument. Or the family will laugh at me because they call me a blond. For example, when someone is telling a joke I'd probably be the last person to get the joke. So they'll laugh at me for being slow at understanding the joke. Or they'll just laugh at anybody @CAPS4's last at understanding the joke. Another way is when a person doesn't do something right, like when they are chopping wood and miss the piece of block, apparently that's funny. Or for no reason my little sister and I will start laughing out of nowhere. Maybe its because we amuse each other or maybe another family member made a funny face. One time my auntie wasn't thinking right and she sat down in a little kid chair that was like a bean bag, and she thought that the chair was a wooden chair. So when she sat down she sank into the bean bag chair and started laughing at her self because she's a blond just like me. Maybe i get my blondness from my auntie. These are my true stories of time's that make my family. There's the family stories, the hilarious but corny @CAPS10, and there's stories of just being yourself and making a person laugh. But its great to laugh!

112,21786,8," We had been watching each other for weeks; our eyes had never once met, but we both knew what the other one felt. @CAPS3 wasn't the kind of person I ever expected to like me. @CAPS3 was a popular, good looking, smart, a great athlete, @CAPS7 a year older than me. I was just a quirky girl who, after moving back to the town I had grown up in, couldn't find the place where I once belonged. Something in his eyes though, told me. It was when I was sitting on the bench in @LOCATION1 with my best friend during a game of dodge-ball when she said something about him.  ""@CAPS1,"" she pointed at him. ""@CAPS2't @CAPS3 hot? Coach told him to come @CAPS7 play dodge-ball with us. @CAPS3's was sent from heaven."" ""I know, right?"" I giggled. ""@CAPS3's been staring at me!"" ""@CAPS4 uh!"" ""I swear."" The coach called us back into the game, ""@CAPS5 break!"" I got up, ran onto the court @CAPS7 scaled out my opponents. There was @PERSON1, the kid who loomed over all of us with his tough attitude @CAPS7 huge biceps. Don't get hit by him, I thought. There was the @PERSON2, the shyest girl in our class who couldn't hurt anything even if her life depended on it. Get her out first, was my next mental note. Then I looked to the furthest part of the court @CAPS7 saw @PERSON3 @CAPS7 @PERSON4, the two class clowns who doubled as tough jocks. I'll @CAPS1 out for them, I decided. The coach was counting down now, ""@CAPS6... two... one... GO!"" @CAPS7 with that, we all sprinted to the center line @CAPS7 grabbed what dodge-balls we could @CAPS7 retreated to our spots on the court. Not having retrieved any ammunition to knock out the other team, I found my place on the court as the battle began, but there @CAPS3 was on the other side of the line opposing me. I could feel my heart beating a hundred times a second. I picked up one of the rubber balls that rolled towards my feet @CAPS7 aimed it at him with what I thought was going to be an almighty throw. Instead, it slipped out of my fingers @CAPS7 bounced slowly towards him on the other side of the court.  @CAPS3 picked it up @CAPS7 looked straight at me with a smirk.  I ran backwards to get as far away from his pitch as I could @CAPS7 tripped over my untied shoe lace. Next thing I knew, I was laying face up on the floor with a group of kids staring down at me. There was a fluster of people trying to help me up @CAPS7 asking if I was okay, but before I could answer any of their questions I made eye contact with the boy @CAPS7 let out a giggle. @CAPS3 chuckled @CAPS7 suddenly the two of us had burst out into a fit of laughter at what an clumsy person I had just proven to be. ""I didn't even need to throw the ball at you!"" @CAPS3 said, still laughing. ""I might as well just go sit down on the bench!"" I agreed. After that, even though the idea of even talking to him seemed intimidating, I decided that if we could laugh together then we would probably have a good conversation together.  Now, after a year spending every day with him, making him laugh @CAPS7 him doing the same for me, I remember what I saw in his eyes that day. I saw a person who would change my so far very short life @CAPS7 make it fun @CAPS7 exciting each second.

But laughing doesn't always make yourself feel good,i think laughing also makes other people around you feel better,it gives off a good vibe that makes you feel happier.You can also use laughing to give a impression that your a good person,like in job interviews when you go in smiling and looking cheerful i think it gives a good first impression then going in looking all sad and depressed.I think when i see a person that i don't know and i just meet them i usually can tell who they are in the first ten minutes of meeting them just by how their personality strikes me.If i meet a new friend and their just sitting there all quiet and laid back i think to myself if that person is hiding something or why arnt they joining in our conversation.I also get the impression that they might be boring to be around,and no one likes to be around boring people. If i go out to the mall or town to hangout with someone i like to have conversations and laughter while we are walking and hanging out if a person never laughs then i think they are quiet most of the time and they are anti social.Even with my mom,when we go out,we share a few laughs,me and my mother are pretty close to,if we don't have a conversation here and there she tends to think im fading away from her.Im growing up now so i have to communicate with her a lot more or she is gonna think im trying to desert her.And making jokes and laughing is what keeps us together even through all the stuff we go through in our life's.So to me this is how i see it,laughing is a big part of our life's and ourselves in general,its what makes us who we are,so if your someone who doesn't enjoy laughter or jokes i think you have a part missing out of you.

sarcastically to piss people off,laughter can be used in all different kinds of situations.For example,im in my house with some of my friends and we're sitting on my couch in my room playing black ops and laughing at the kids that are loosing to make them more mad after each round.I like to laugh,im usually with a group of kids that make me laugh and like to joke around a lot.Being with someone that is funny is a lot better than hanging out with someone that is always sad and depressed all the time.I mean if im sad one day,the friends i have will cheer me up or make me laugh to make me feel better and forget what was wrong in the beginning.I have a cousin that is @NUM1 and she is a big cry baby,if she doesn't get what she wants she will flip out and start crying.So i have to do something

That's is how my best friend @CAPS2 and I met. It was just like love at first sight, but instead it was best friends forever at first sight. It was ten years ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was five years old and she was six. I had just transferred from @ORGANIZATION1 school. On my first day at @LOCATION1 school, I met @CAPS2. The teachers introduced us and asked @CAPS2 if she would show me around the school. I remember being extremely nervous and I didn't think that I was going to be able to make any new friends. A week went by and @CAPS2 and I got closer and closer. We were always laughing at something. It didn't matter how ridiculous it was, but we would still laugh. Laughing was and still always get us in trouble during class. When that first week of school went by we promised each other that we would be best friends forever no matter what. We got our parents to let us @CAPS1 slumber parties almost every weekend. That was a lot of fun! I remember this one time we were playing on the ""spider dome"" and she lost her balance and I was sitting right beside her on the top and she was about to fall, and I grabber her arm hoping that she wouldn't fall, but she pulled me down with her. The first thing that we did as soon as we hit the ground was laugh. The recess duty ladies rushed over to see if we were alright, and we were just laying there on the ground, legs tangled up in one another laughing. They took us to the health center to get bandages, because we scraped out knees and elbows on the way down. The office called our parents and told them what happened because they were inspired by how close of friends were. When I got home I begged my mom to take me to the store so I could get a friendship necklaces for @CAPS2 and I, and she finally took me. I picked our a pink heart broke in half.One half said best and the other half said friend. It looked like it had been broke right down the middle. That basically means I'm not complete without you. Each half of the heart fits together like a puzzle. Unfortunately we were at the river one hot @DATE2 day and we both lost our necklaces in the water and we spent the longest time looking for them, they were never found. Now we @CAPS1 matching necklaces but they are sterling silver with the letter k on it hanging from a chain. We chose the letter k because my name is @CAPS7, and hers is @CAPS2. We wear them everyday. I'm fifteen now and she is sixteen years old and it seems like everyday we become closer and closer. We still @CAPS1 slumber parties almost every weekend. We are on our high school @CAPS9 team together. I love @CAPS2 like a sister. Shes family and I don't know what I would do with out her. We @CAPS1 a anniversary ever @DATE1, because that's the month we met ten years ago. When you @CAPS1 a best friend and he or she is like family, don't let anything become between you two. People don't need more than one really close friend in my opinion. I had three close girlfriends at one time, but it didn't work out. They were all jealous of each other except @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is very laid back and rolls with the flow. Girls are very hard to get along with, that's why I @CAPS1 many more guy friends that girlfriends. Every friend that I @CAPS1 now, I met through laughing at something somewhere along the road.

That's is how my best friend @CAPS2 and I met. It was just like love at first sight, but instead it was best friends forever at first sight. It was ten years ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was five years old and she was six. I had just transferred from @ORGANIZATION1 school. On my first day at @LOCATION1 school, I met @CAPS2. The teachers introduced us and asked @CAPS2 if she would show me around the school. I remember being extremely nervous and I didn't think that I was going to be able to make any new friends. A week went by and @CAPS2 and I got closer and closer. We were always laughing at something. It didn't matter how ridiculous it was, but we would still laugh. Laughing was and still always get us in trouble during class. When that first week of school went by we promised each other that we would be best friends forever no matter what. We got our parents to let us @CAPS1 slumber parties almost every weekend. That was a lot of fun! I remember this one time we were playing on the ""spider dome"" and she lost her balance and I was sitting right beside her on the top and she was about to fall, and I grabber her arm hoping that she wouldn't fall, but she pulled me down with her. The first thing that we did as soon as we hit the ground was laugh. The recess duty ladies rushed over to see if we were alright, and we were just laying there on the ground, legs tangled up in one another laughing. They took us to the health center to get bandages, because we scraped out knees and elbows on the way down. The office called our parents and told them what happened because they were inspired by how close of friends were. When I got home I begged my mom to take me to the store so I could get a friendship necklaces for @CAPS2 and I, and she finally took me. I picked our a pink heart broke in half.One half said best and the other half said friend. It looked like it had been broke right down the middle. That basically means I'm not complete without you. Each half of the heart fits together like a puzzle. Unfortunately we were at the river one hot @DATE2 day and we both lost our necklaces in the water and we spent the longest time looking for them, they were never found. Now we @CAPS1 matching necklaces but they are sterling silver with the letter k on it hanging from a chain. We chose the letter k because my name is @CAPS7, and hers is @CAPS2. We wear them everyday. I'm fifteen now and she is sixteen years old and it seems like everyday we become closer and closer. We still @CAPS1 slumber parties almost every weekend. We are on our high school @CAPS9 team together. I love @CAPS2 like a sister. Shes family and I don't know what I would do with out her. We @CAPS1 a anniversary ever @DATE1, because that's the month we met ten years ago. When you @CAPS1 a best friend and he or she is like family, don't let anything become between you two. People don't need more than one really close friend in my opinion. I had three close girlfriends at one time, but it didn't work out. They were all jealous of each other except @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is very laid back and rolls with the flow. Girls are very hard to get along with, that's why I @CAPS1 many more guy friends that girlfriends.

He always made her laugh, and she could never figur out why. Was it his smile, or his eyes? She could never figure out why no matter how hard she tried. But she loved how he could just make it come out of her. They hadn't been together for a real long time, but just long enough to know each other very well. It's like they were best friends before ever meeting. they botha had amazing athletic abilitys, personality, and they always had family and friends there for support. They had a connection that could be sent through them like a text message or a I.M message. Both were honest, reliable, and had great respect for those around them, but most importantly for each other. They made time for each other but also for others as well, they had alot of fun with groups more often than any. What made it fun was they knew how to laugh. They both believed that knowing how to laugh was just as important as all the other key points in a healthy relationship. John and @PERSON1 were pretty serious before they had started dating. Serious about their sports, academics, and of course family and friends. They didnt really know how to have fun until they met. It's like they had forgotten how to laugh. But with them coming together and learning how to have fun and laugh, while staying focused on what was important, they can do other things to. realizing that having fun and laughing through each other, that it was critical for them in their relationship. Laughing showed them that the farthest people in a relatonship, can grow as close as anything can get with the small thing called laughter. As their relationship grew they begain to have a ton of fun with their friends and each other, it helped them more and more with family relatonships. I think that laughing is a daily part of someones life, and that it's healthy for people to laugh, even at the smallest things. I know personally that it strengthens relationships, breaks ice in an awkward moment, and adds contrast to the everyday painted picture. It's like a new color, or a brighter one to life. It becomes a major part in work, social life, growing up and just the random small things that are thrown at us everyday. We can laugh at old mistakes, at memory's or when we do or see something funny, it's just a everyday reaction. It's all part of our thought and learning process of experiencing new things. I think it can help us find who we are inside and who we can be when we grow older and more mature. I think, laughing is also just one of our natural reactions. Not just to something fun ny, but just to other things that might trigger a memory, or a time you were getting yelled at and afterwards thought it was funny, or knowing you made a dumb mistake. I personally know that I laugh at myself for something I did or said or just something I got in trouble for by a silly mistake. The fact remains as it is; ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". It does help relationships, it brings the two people together closer than anything. If we didnt know how to laugh or have fun, I think this world would be very dull and boring, and everyone would just end up hating or strongly disliking alot of things. It's healthly to laugh and also have fun with it. It's all over the world being experienced by millions of people. and it's also one of the key points to a healthy relationship. To me, it's like and oreo cookie and milk, or a two piece, or pencil and paper. No doubt that laughter is what fits perfectly together with everything in the world, and also life.

We do everything together. Just like most friendships we have minor disagreements, nothing serious, but that same day we talk it out just like how everyone should.

I took it out of my pocket and shut it off. We both started laughing. It was so funny @ORGANIZATION1 us because it was silent then all you hear is the flute playing from my pocket. This happened @DATE1, and @ORGANIZATION1 this day we still talk about it. Let me rewind back @ORGANIZATION1 my @NUM3 grade year. I met most of my good friends during this change from @ORGANIZATION1. My good friend @CAPS4 is amazing @ORGANIZATION1 this day just as I met her. We had all the same classes. We never talked until the @ORGANIZATION1 of the year in math class. I sat behind a eccentric boy named @CAPS5, across from him sat @CAPS4. She was quiet I didn't hear her talk much. One day, my friend made a miniature paper crane. Small enough that it can sit on your thumb nail. It was sitting on my binder when @CAPS5 took it and started @ORGANIZATION1 examine it. This caught @CAPS4's attention and she started @ORGANIZATION1 talk @ORGANIZATION1 me if I made it or not. Before I could answer @CAPS5 then stuffed it in @CAPS10 mouth. I was completely shocked. @CAPS13 spit it out and started @ORGANIZATION1 play with it even more. @CAPS13 called it ""@CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12"" @CAPS13 would throw it and toss it, while I tried @ORGANIZATION1 get it from him. @CAPS13 tossed it up so high it landed on top of the lights we had in class that was above him. @CAPS4 and I looked at each other and started @ORGANIZATION1 laugh, and so did @CAPS5. @CAPS13 apologized for what @CAPS13 did. I didn't mind it. I had another one in my bag in my locker anyway. This started the friendship I treasure. Its been @NUM4 @DATE1 since that occurred. We still talk about that day.  Laughter is just as important @ORGANIZATION1 a friendship and also @ORGANIZATION1 keep families together. My family is odd. Just like everyone's family. My mom is a lot like myself. She doesn't joke like me and my dad do, but over all like me. My @CAPS12 is so funny. @CAPS13 is younger than I am by @DATE1 @DATE1. @CAPS13 makes my mom and I laugh a lot. @CAPS13 can imitate voices such as: The @CAPS15 @CAPS16, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 the @CAPS17 @CAPS18, and just weird sounding voices in general. My @CAPS12 and I used @ORGANIZATION1 not get along very well, but now we don't fight like we used @ORGANIZATION1 anymore. I'm glad we don't. Laughter is an amazing thing of life. It makes things worth the ride, even if your dreadfully falling or taking the wrong dusty long road in this world. As long as you have someone by your side making you laugh, everything will be fine. I love my friends and family for making my life worth the ride so far, I can't think of how this world will be with out the musical sound of laughter. It would be dull, and have no reason @ORGANIZATION1 be on this earth we call home. I will not be in high @ORGANIZATION1 for long. I might not know all the friends I have @DATE2. So, I never hold grudges, I make amends easily if they are willing. I want my high @ORGANIZATION1 @DATE1 @ORGANIZATION1 be wonderful. So far I am having fun laughing and never forgetting the day I laughed so hard I cried. Once I am ""All @CAPS20 up"" I'll look back and remember how much I loved high @ORGANIZATION1 yet I hated it, the drama kills me. It wont matter in ten @DATE1 maybe even one year.

Laughing helps a child in need of love and nourishment, and it helps an adult find the beauty in the world. Every since I was a little girl my parents always told me that laughing is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and that if I were to show one emotion my entire life, it should be laughing. I took this great advice under consideration my past @NUM1 years and now everyday I laugh, doesn't matter what kind of mood I'm in, I always laugh with either a friend who told a funny joke or just that the sun came out when the weather reports said that it was going to be raining all day, I laugh and enjoy the life I have been blessed with. There is one specific story that I remember @CAPS7 so well because it was one of the @CAPS2 stories of my life and it in fact involves my @CAPS2 friend @PERSON1 and I laughing our heads off. The day started off being a cold, dark, stormy day on the @ORGANIZATION1, even though it was @DATE1.

My mother, sister, @PERSON1 and I were off to @LOCATION1's capital, @CAPS4 for a weekend away and school shopping.

Her plan was to go to the hotel, get checked in, put our luggage into the rooms, go out to eat, then come back and relax and just wait til the @CAPS1 day to go shopping and have fun. ""@CAPS7 man, her face was priceless,"" says @PERSON1, who is still currently my @CAPS2 friend. I was definitely mad about the plans of the day, and my mother could tell already that that day was going to be horrific. I hate to admit this, but I'm the type of person who wants everything to go their way, and if someone else has something to say, well lets just say that that's not going to be a pretty sight. I ended up doing what my mother planned and trust me I was dying inside. By sunset, I was definitely on edge and all I wanted to do was ignore everyone and go to bed. But luckily my trustworthy friend pulled me aside because she knows how to calm me down and told me that when we get back to the hotel we were going to do something crazy. Which of course we did, because we always do something crazy even if we aren't meaning to. @CAPS8 I was freaking out about what we were going to do, I could see little gears inside @PERSON1's head that were turning very quickly @CAPS8 she came up with ideas.

We were in fifth grade and all the girls in my class were invited.  @CAPS1 was tuning eleven and her birthday was a big deal. We had been talking about everything we would do at it that week. We were going to watch scary movies, play hide and seek, and then stay up all night. Staying up all night and watching scary movies when you were in fifth grade was a big deal and we all wanted to do it. The day had finally come. @CAPS1's birthday was the day @DATE1 break started. We all rode the bus together talking and laughing about boys and all the silly stuff we did that day. We grabbed our bags, hopped off the bus and ran down @CAPS1's driveway to her house.  When we got there @CAPS1's mom, @ORGANIZATION1 had bought candy for us and was making sure we ate it. She wanted us to be hyper for the day part of @CAPS1's birthday party, but wanted us to crash by the night so she could get some sleep because she had to work the next day. Her idea didn't work very well for her, we were up all night making noise, talking, and laughing. We sang her happy birthday, and ate our cake but there was a lot left over.  @ORGANIZATION1 didn't want it taking up room in her refrigerator so she told @CAPS1 to go get something out of her room. When she was gone @ORGANIZATION1 told us to each grab a piece of cake and we were going to throw it at her. When she came back in the room she was so surprised when she got about eight pieces of cake thrown in her face. We started a full on food fight and had so much fun. With cake in our hair and all over the floor we went outside and used the hose to get it off of us as @ORGANIZATION1 cleaned the cake covered floor. After our food fight we played some board games and talked more, which led to us laughing more and more. We decided we wanted to watch the scary movie now and everyone was really anxious but nervous. All six of us sat on the couch huddled together as the movie started. By the end of the movie @PERSON1 was too scared to even go to the bathroom by herself so, so she had to have someone go to the bathroom with her. After many screams and a lot of laughter the scary movie was over, and decided to go out and play hide and go seek. We got into our groups of two and started. After about an hour we were getting kind of bored of the game, my friend and I decided we should go scare other people hiding because everyone was still scared from the movie. So our innocent game of hide and go seek turned into who can scare who the most. We went inside had hot chocolate and laughed about what all had happened that day.

A few of our differences would be that I grew up old school I was raised to be a good man always treating my significant other with the respect she deserved and to be the man of the relationship which would fall under being there for her whenever she needed me no matter the circumstances, loving her through thick and thin etc. The ways I treated her were different to her somewhat new she never really had a man that treated her as an equal a little bit of her background would be that she was raised thinking every man was the same in every way they all cheated, they all hurt her both physically and mentally and most of all that she would never get the respect she deserved. For her to think like that and be raised in that particular environment was devastating for a person like myself to actually believe and to turn away from a girl like that would to me not be the wisest decision. As time went on things got bad just like any mature relationship we had gone threw a hard time of her father passing away directly after mine and her birthday's also an old relationship floating to the surface interfering with our relationship although we had gone threw tough times we still managed to stick together. Not very many people have that such luck or type of love when they're young the amazing thing that helped us through our hard times were love, respect, honor, and surprisingly ""laughter"". Our love started earlier than a typical mature adult relationship even though we showed and said we loved each other it grew stronger by every day that passed we both never let a day go by without showing and proving our love to each other no matter the situation even to this day. The respect and honor were more of an automatic type of thing for us we both grew up learning to always respect and honor our significant other it was a matter of importance if you didn't respect or honor the person you were in a relationship with than in our eyes the chances of it lasting are very slim. How laughter is surprising is because we would argue a minimum four times a day everyday, for a couple to argue that many times a day over the smallest things personally is unhealthy in any relationship. The laughter being a very important thing is because no matter how angry we get towards one another something always happens or is said that makes us laugh, for the both of us we love each others laugh the way I laugh to her is she knows I'm not always serious and I can be a very kind, funny, sweet, and caring man. How I love her laugh is because it isn't necessarily a laugh it is more like a sweet giggle that tells she is also very sweet, funny, caring, and has so very much love for her significant other. I can recall a time which laughter came into play there was a time I had said something wrong not really wrong but it had been said in the worst possible way in saying that we started to argue and fight saying things that weren't meant to come out. Just like anyone else that is angry they say certain things that are very hurtful and wouldn't normally be said when they are in a calm state of mind. Although we had said very hurtful words to one another we had stopped talking to each other for the entire day, later that evening I had gotten a phone call from her nothing was said for almost ten

I remember a day when we decided to make the @NUM2 minute drive to @LOCATION1 and see if the waves where small enough for me and my family to surf. When we got there the waves where big, it was a medium size for @LOCATION1 but that @LOCATION1 can have waves that are big enough you could fit your whole house in the barrel. We sat up on the top of the cliff next to the the path down to the @LOCATION1, the tide was dropping and if we didn't go out soon the rocks and coral would start to come out of the water and that could be a problem for all of us.  I ran back to the car and put on my wet suit, the water there is warm but not so warm that you can spend an hour or two in just your swimsuit. My board was leaning agents the fence next to the cliff, it's @NUM3, @NUM4"", wide in the middle and light blue, my favorite board. I snatched it up and ran down the trail to the @LOCATION1, I had to beat my brother onto the water.   The water was shallow only about two feet deep in some spots, the sea weed was tall enough to reach the surface and the paddle out was hard, after about @NUM5 yard the bottom dropped away and I could see the beautiful coral bottom below me. I was starting to get into the waves now, duck diving the first five or six, the waves where gradually getting bigger. I paddled off to the left away form the point where the waves hadn't broken yet. The ocean was a light blue and perfectly clear.  I final made it out back, I sat down on my board and looked back toward the @LOCATION1, my brother and my uncle paddling out, they had just passed the weeds. up on the hill I saw my mom and dad, they looked like dots on the horizon, it was a long paddle. I decided to wait for my brother and uncle to get to me before I caught some waves.  My brother caught the first wave of the day as usual, he always paddles for every wave, even if there not the best. He got an @CAPS1 ride, head bobbing up and down behind the wave made me laugh. I look behind me to see if there where any waves coming, there was a big set, the waves we had been waiting for, I paddled out deeper so that the wave wouldn't crash on my head and crush me. My uncle let me have it he would get plenty of waves later. I was in perfect position of the second wave, I turned around and paddled as hard as I could, the wave shot under me and picked me up. ""you got it,"" my uncle yelled. I stood up quick, jumping straight to my feet, standing on top of the wave I could see the coral bottom about three feet below the surface. In some spots as the wave sucked up the water, the rocks came through the surface. I had to stay near the top of the wave to avoid hitting them. My brother was watching me, I turned back up the face of the wave and bounced my board off the lip as it started to curl back toward me. Baring off I turned back down the face to gain speed then went for the big jump. I flew off the top of the wave and dove over the back of the foaming mass. We stayed there and surfed for about an hour and a half, the tide got to low so we came in.

124,21799,8," It was a cloudy day in the small town I lived in, perfect if you ask me. A slight chill in the air, the smell of a thunderstorm soon approaching, and not many people on the streets. These were my favorite kinds of days. Sunny days are nice too, but I prefer the slight cold and the peaceful feeling I get from the looming clouds overhead. I decided to spend this perfect day with my best friend, @PERSON1. He and I had been best friends all our lives, and I know he would appreciate the day just as much as I did. I walked to his house, and from there we walked to the park. We sat on the swings and talked for hours. After awhile, the subject matter got to be a bit difficult. @PERSON1's mother had been battling addiction for a long time, and she had relapsed once again, leaving @PERSON1 to care for the house and his younger siblings alone. His paychecks already went mostly towards his family's needs, but it wasn't going to be enough to support them all completely. I had been making some good money at the time, and offered to help. @PERSON1's reaction was not at all what I expected.  He sat silent for a moment, just staring at me with a cold expression in his eyes. When he finally spoke, his words stung me like a slap in the face. ""I dont need your pity money. I can do it on my own."" I didn't know what to say. I couldn't have spoken a word, anyway, due to the swelling lump in my throat. When I finally swallowed down the pain, I told him that I would never pity him, and that I had no idea where he could've gotten that impression from. I had always tried to help when things got rough, just like he had always helped me through the hard times in my life. We were there for eachother, no matter what. That's the way it had always been. I asked him why he would say something like that, and he told me that he didn't need me. I didn't know what else to say or do, so I just got up and left. I walked all the way home by myself. He made no attempt to come after me or apolagize. He just sat on the swing, staring at the ground. A light rain began to fall as I walked, the cold raindrops mixing with the warm tears on my cheek. I was grateful for the rain because it hid the fact that I was crying, for the most part. @PERSON1 and I didn't talk for weeks after that. It was really hard for me, because he was really my only friend. Then, on a @DATE1 @TIME1, a knock came at the door. I opened it to find @PERSON1 on my porch. I resisted the urge to smile and hug him and tell him how much I missed him. Instead, I just stood there staring, waiting for him to speak. He said nothing, but pulled a picture from his back pocket and gave it to me. It was of he and I when we were very little kids, at his birthday party. We were playing with his new boxing gloves. I was punching him in the face when the picture was taken. On the back of the picture he had written, ""@CAPS1 sorry, I dont know what I was thinking. I've still got the gloves ... You deserve a free shot.""  I couldn't hold the smile back any longer after that. When I reterned my gaze to @PERSON1, he was holding the small, red boxing gloves that he had gotten that day. I burst out laughing and hugged him. He hugged me back, and we stayed like that for a few minutes. I invited him into my house, and we were back to our normal selves again. We spent the rest of the @TIME1 goofing off and laughing and just having fun. The disagreement was forgotten, and we were best friends again.  They say that laughter heals all wounds, and after that @TIME1 I believed it. The hurt that I had felt dissappeared, replaced by happiness. @PERSON1 allowed me to help him out with his money problems, and together we held the house down for his mother until she got clean again.",24799,36,52,858,3739,3.503496503,16.5, it was a cloudy day in the small town i lived in  perfect if you ask me  a slight chill in the air  the smell of a thunderstorm soon approaching  and not many people on the streets  these were my favorite kinds of days  sunny days are nice too  but i prefer the slight cold and the peaceful feeling i get from the looming clouds overhead  i decided to spend this perfect day with my best friend  he and i had been best friends all our lives  and i know he would appreciate the day just as much as i did  i walked to his house  and from there we walked to the park  we sat on the swings and talked for hours  after awhile  the subject matter got to be a bit difficult  mother had been battling addiction for a long time  and she had relapsed once again  leaving to care for the house and his younger siblings alone  his paychecks already went mostly towards his family s needs  but it wasn t going to be enough to support them all completely  i had been making some good money at the time  and offered to help  reaction was not at all what i expected   he sat silent for a moment  just staring at me with a cold expression in his eyes  when he finally spoke  his words stung me like a slap in the face   i dont need your pity money  i can do it on my own   i didn t know what to say  i couldn t have spoken a word  anyway  due to the swelling lump in my throat  when i finally swallowed down the pain  i told him that i would never pity him  and that i had no idea where he could ve gotten that impression from  i had always tried to help when things got rough  just like he had always helped me through the hard times in my life  we were there for eachother  no matter what  that s the way it had always been  i asked him why he would say something like that  and he told me that he didn t need me  i didn t know what else to say or do  so i just got up and left  i walked all the way home by myself  he made no attempt to come after me or apolagize  he just sat on the swing  staring at the ground  a light rain began to fall as i walked  the cold raindrops mixing with the warm tears on my cheek  i was grateful for the rain because it hid the fact that i was crying  for the most part  and i didn t talk for weeks after that  it was really hard for me  because he was really my only friend  then  on a a knock came at the door  i opened it to find on my porch  i resisted the urge to smile and hug him and tell him how much i missed him  instead  i just stood there staring  waiting for him to speak  he said nothing  but pulled a picture from his back pocket and gave it to me  it was of he and i when we were very little kids  at his birthday party  we were playing with his new boxing gloves  i was punching him in the face when the picture was taken  on the back of the picture he had written    caps sorry  i dont know what i was thinking  i ve still got the gloves     you deserve a free shot    i couldn t hold the smile back any longer after that  when i reterned my gaze to he was holding the small  red boxing gloves that he had gotten that day  i burst out laughing and hugged him  he hugged me back  and we stayed like that for a few minutes  i invited him into my house  and we were back to our normal selves again  we spent the rest of the goofing off and laughing and just having fun  the disagreement was forgotten  and we were best friends again   they say that laughter heals all wounds  and after that i believed it  the hurt that i had felt dissappeared  replaced by happiness  allowed me to help him out with his money problems  and together we held the house down for his mother until she got clean again ,876,81,119,109,40,30,52,151,10,"It was a cloudy day in the small town I lived in, perfect if you ask me.

129,21809,8," Hey there my name is @LOCATION1 and i chose to write about a time that me and my four friends chose to make an adventure to the cemetery. It was hilarious and memorable at the same time. Well the day started off as any other day got up got ready for school and was out the door. When I got to school my best friend @CAPS1 was waiting outside. So I went with her through the breakfast line so she could get something to eat. Then we went to are class cause we had first period together. After class was over we ran into are friend @PERSON2. @CAPS1 asked him if he could give us a ride after school to our house and he said yes. Well the day went on and on. Finally it was the end of the school day and it was time for @CAPS1, @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and me to start are adventure. First of all, instead of @CAPS1 and me going home we decided that we wanted to hangout with the boys. So went over are friend @PERSON3's house for a few hours and were hanging out playing games and listening to music. So after those few hours passed by @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 decided that we should take an adventure to the cemetery down the road. @CAPS1 and I were all over it. So we got in the car and head to the cemetery. So on are way to get to the cemetery you have to go down a gravel road. Well @PERSON2 decided instead of go @NUM1 @CAPS4 like any normal person would he decided that he was going to speed up. So as we were flying down this gravel road and we were near the end. Out of no where there was a sharp corner. Well @CAPS1 and me didn't know it was there but the boys did. @PERSON2 pulled his emergency break and thought we would just drift around the corner. Well think again @PERSON2 lost control of the car and almost slammed me into a huge tree.  Finally we got to the spot that we were going and we parked the car and then out of no where @CAPS1 decided that she needed to use the restroom. We all started laughing and @PERSON1 said there are no bathrooms up here. So she decided that she was going to just go behind a tree, but she wanted me to go with her, so I did. Well as she was going to the bathroom she looked at me and said, do you hear that, and said, yes. We both hear what sounded like someone with a chainsaw coming up the side of the hill. Well she was done and we both took off running to the car. We got to the car and @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 decided that it would be funny to lock the car doors. @CAPS1 and me were almost in tears case we thought we were going to get murdered, but they finally unlocked the doors and we sat there for a little while waiting to see if anyone was going to come up the hill with a chainsaw. In conclusion, you @MONTH1 not think its that funny cause at the time I was scared out of my mind, but looking back on it, it was one of the best times I had ever spent with the tree of them. So that was my funny story and I hope you enjoy it.

Experiencing moments of disgrace, one always seems to look for a way to up lift their state of @CAPS1 or glum moments, even when they can not see any resolution to their problems. Even when one appears to have no sense in life, a certain event could switch things around unexpectedly.  I always appeared to have disagreements with people, especially with my older sister. We can never agree on who is right or accept when we are wrong. We can never give in into the others ideas or listen to what we have to say. Even though she is the older sister, I tried to compete at her level, and out smart with what I learned or out stand her accomplishments. Our sister bonding time became a competition, mainly for me to prove my intelligence and agility in areas I knew she was weak in.  After a long exhausting week of school, we both road on the bus home together. We always tried to sit on different seats, and maintain our distance so that other people could not compare or tell that we were sisters. My curly hair set me apart from what I thought to be black, lifeless hair of her's. Unfortunately, more of the high-school students decided to ride our bus, and jam pack each seat, causing for us to sit together. Clutter together like a pair of sardines, we shoved and pushed on each turn the bus made on the corners of the way home. To make things worse, she decided I were to sit next to the window were I was suffocated, and compressed like a chew toy.  Finally reaching our stop, I gained my strength back to push her out off the seat, reaching for air, stuffy from the other people's sweat, and make my way of the bus. I could move freely, but I felt my sisters presences behind me. She was furious from what I had done to her and I knew I wasn't going to be able to get away with it. As I quickly made my way home, I could hear her stubby, short legs creeping behind me. She was rapidly catching up to me with her stubby short legs that seemed to burst in motion, carrying her little body in great speed towards me. My neck was beginning to drip sweat, and I could feel my adrenaline rushing through my body, down to the tips of my fingers. Without expecting it, I was soon on the ground with pressure of someone on top of me. She had tackled me to the cement pavement, and was flapping her arms on top of me. I was shocked of the force she had, and was a bit afraid of how to react since she could never catch up to me when I was escaping her wrath. Not even a minute later, she was squirming on the ground, full of laughter. Her eyes were now a bit red and watery, and was bursting out with chuckles that became contagious. From the sight of seeing her laugh, I could not contain myself, and joined in with her happiness even though I was not aware why she was reacting in such a way. To see her little body that had knocked me down to the ground like a bowling pin, gave me thoughts of how powerful @CAPS1 could be. She was a weak target at this point, but my body became weak when I joined in to her sound of high pitch hollers. Moments after we could speak with clarity, I gathered myself up, and helped my sister to her feet. I was confused if she was still angry or had my sympathetic fall amused her to the point where she had became indulged with joy. I could have remained mad, since she had tackled my to the ground, but why waste a moment of happiness and let frustration ruin a wonderful opportunity to let things flow smoothly and forget about our problems. The air had become lighter and easier to take in, and my walk was steady and relaxing. We had a situation that apparently would have caused a fighter greater than any war fought over acts that were not over thought. If either one of us restrained our self to a laughter that caused for us to get into a moment of peace, we could have been arguing for days. We both knew we could not remain angery for such a reaction on both of our parts, instead we walked home and enjoyed the moment. Such a sound with expressions that are amusing to watch and can become contagious, can cause for a tense moment of @CAPS1 to become an unexpected, up lifting bond between two sisters. Laughter can be full of tears, not necessary tears of disappointment, rather feels of great satisfaction and glee.",24810,44,37,933,4462,3.851018221,25.21621622,                          from to laughter  laughter can lighten up any situation  whether it being after an argument with a certain someone  or during a day of deception and complete disaster  experiencing moments of disgrace  one always seems to look for a way to up lift their state of or glum moments  even when they can not see any resolution to their problems  even when one appears to have no sense in life  a certain event could switch things around unexpectedly   i always appeared to have disagreements with people  especially with my older sister  we can never agree on who is right or accept when we are wrong  we can never give in into the others ideas or listen to what we have to say  even though she is the older sister  i tried to compete at her level  and out smart with what i learned or out stand her accomplishments  our sister bonding time became a competition  mainly for me to prove my intelligence and agility in areas i knew she was weak in   after a long exhausting week of school  we both road on the bus home together  we always tried to sit on different seats  and maintain our distance so that other people could not compare or tell that we were sisters  my curly hair set me apart from what i thought to be black  lifeless hair of her s  unfortunately  more of the high school students decided to ride our bus  and jam pack each seat  causing for us to sit together  clutter together like a pair of sardines  we shoved and pushed on each turn the bus made on the corners of the way home  to make things worse  she decided i were to sit next to the window were i was suffocated  and compressed like a chew toy   finally reaching our stop  i gained my strength back to push her out off the seat  reaching for air  stuffy from the other people s sweat  and make my way of the bus  i could move freely  but i felt my sisters presences behind me  she was furious from what i had done to her and i knew i wasn t going to be able to get away with it  as i quickly made my way home  i could hear her stubby  short legs creeping behind me  she was rapidly catching up to me with her stubby short legs that seemed to burst in motion  carrying her little body in great speed towards me  my neck was beginning to drip sweat  and i could feel my adrenaline rushing through my body  down to the tips of my fingers  without expecting it  i was soon on the ground with pressure of someone on top of me  she had tackled me to the cement pavement  and was flapping her arms on top of me  i was shocked of the force she had  and was a bit afraid of how to react since she could never catch up to me when i was escaping her wrath  not even a minute later  she was squirming on the ground  full of laughter  her eyes were now a bit red and watery  and was bursting out with chuckles that became contagious  from the sight of seeing her laugh  i could not contain myself  and joined in with her happiness even though i was not aware why she was reacting in such a way  to see her little body that had knocked me down to the ground like a bowling pin  gave me thoughts of how powerful could be  she was a weak target at this point  but my body became weak when i joined in to her sound of high pitch hollers  moments after we could speak with clarity  i gathered myself up  and helped my sister to her feet  i was confused if she was still angry or had my sympathetic fall amused her to the point where she had became indulged with joy  i could have remained mad  since she had tackled my to the ground  but why waste a moment of happiness and let frustration ruin a wonderful opportunity to let things flow smoothly and forget about our problems  the air had become lighter and easier to take in  and my walk was steady and relaxing  we had a situation that apparently would have caused a fighter greater than any war fought over acts that were not over thought  if either one of us restrained our self to a laughter that caused for us to get into a moment of peace  we could have been arguing for days  we both knew we could not remain angery for such a reaction on both of our parts  instead we walked home and enjoyed the moment  such a sound with expressions that are amusing to watch and can become contagious  can cause for a tense moment of to become an unexpected  up lifting bond between two sisters  laughter can be full of tears  not necessary tears of disappointment  rather feels of great satisfaction and glee ,1092,122,120,151,55,35,43,134,1,"From @CAPS1 to Laughter Laughter can lighten up any situation, whether it being after an argument with a certain someone, or during a day of deception and complete disaster.

I could move freely, but I felt my sisters presences behind me. She was furious from what I had done to her and I knew I wasn't going to be able to get away with it. As I quickly made my way home, I could hear her stubby, short legs creeping behind me. She was rapidly catching up to me with her stubby short legs that seemed to burst in motion, carrying her little body in great speed towards me. My neck was beginning to drip sweat, and I could feel my adrenaline rushing through my body, down to the tips of my fingers. Without expecting it, I was soon on the ground with pressure of someone on top of me. She had tackled me to the cement pavement, and was flapping her arms on top of me. I was shocked of the force she had, and was a bit afraid of how to react since she could never catch up to me when I was escaping her wrath. Not even a minute later, she was squirming on the ground, full of laughter. Her eyes were now a bit red and watery, and was bursting out with chuckles that became contagious. From the sight of seeing her laugh, I could not contain myself, and joined in with her happiness even though I was not aware why she was reacting in such a way. To see her little body that had knocked me down to the ground like a bowling pin, gave me thoughts of how powerful @CAPS1 could be. She was a weak target at this point, but my body became weak when I joined in to her sound of high pitch hollers. Moments after we could speak with clarity, I gathered myself up, and helped my sister to her feet. I was confused if she was still angry or had my sympathetic fall amused her to the point where she had became indulged with joy. I could have remained mad, since she had tackled my to the ground, but why waste a moment of happiness and let frustration ruin a wonderful opportunity to let things flow smoothly and forget about our problems. The air had become lighter and easier to take in, and my walk was steady and relaxing. We had a situation that apparently would have caused a fighter greater than any war fought over acts that were not over thought. If either one of us restrained our self to a laughter that caused for us to get into a moment of peace, we could have been arguing for days. We both knew we could not remain angery for such a reaction on both of our parts, instead we walked home and enjoyed the moment. Such a sound with expressions that are amusing to watch and can become contagious, can cause for a tense moment of @CAPS1 to become an unexpected, up lifting bond between two sisters.

One gray and rainy day a few years ago, my aunt, my little brother, and myself were at the store buying food for the next days thanksgiving dinner. I wasn't in the best of moods because my three year old brother was acting hysterical over a silly spider-man toy that both my aunt and I both refused to buy him. I felt bad that I couldn't buy it for him but I was and unemployed fifteen year old, what more can I say. Because the little guy was denied his desired action figure he was angry. By the time we were at the car he had settled down a whole lot, but he was still upset. My aunt gets stressed real easily so when she is trying to get an angry three year old to calm down the whole time were in the store she's not going to be what you would call cheerful, and when she is not happy she turns to cigarettes, unhealthy I know. So after i buckled up my brother in his car seat and my aunt and I put the groceries in the car, my aunt set her keys on the front seat. Me being the goof that that I am locked all the doors to the car! I was outside talking to my aunt while she smoked and neither of us realized that I had just locked an angry three year old in the vehicle.

My aunt said, ""@CAPS1 unlock the door please"" he is a smart boy so he knew what she was talking about, so instead of doing what she asked he stuck his tongue out, then said no shaking his head! We both continued to try to get @CAPS1 to unlock the door. Around the tenth time we asked him, he decided to open the ash tray where my aunt had some pennies, and then i guess he thought it would be funny to eat one!

When getting back to my cabin I was out of breath and convenunly forgot my waterbottel at the pool. Exsaperated @CAPS1 on my bed not realizing that @PERSON1, the crying girl was in the cabin. To my shock she offered her water to me. Although not wanting to talk to her, I took the water and thanked her. We slowly started to get to talking and i found out that she was actually pretty ammusing. We laugh for a while together then desided to go back down and swim together. We were inseperable. After we talked that one day she never cried at camp again and we even remand best of friends through out the whole @DATE1. Before school was getting ready to be in session again, @PERSON1 told me that the resion she cried so much at camp is because her parents devorce became final the week before and it hit her harder that she thought it would have. She thought that if she just stayed to her self and wasnt very outgoing that people would not notice she was hurt and just ignor her. She also told me that if i had never started talking to her and saying jokes and funny things that had happened she never would have opened up to me and camp would have been the longest seven days of her life. This makes me realize that for her laughter was the difrence between us and that with me and my hummor i was able to make a friend but also help someone deal with all the problems she was facing. Thanks to my mother telling this simple, yet important saying my life was changed for the better. @PERSON1 and I are still best of friends today. This shows that laughter is so important in any realtionship.

133,21813,8," Laughter, the sound that people make when hearing or sighting something funny or just brightens someones day. I think laughter is important in the human life because its the cure for having a bad day. @CAPS1 can brighten someones day or save someone from jumping off a building. I'm going to tell you a story where laughter saved my life. Have you ever lost someone or something close to you and feel empty inside? I was two years old. My dad always talked about getting a dog. My father and I bought him as a puppy at a small farm in sandy @ORGANIZATION2. We where on are way back from a beautiful day skiing on @LOCATION1. We drove through sandy and saw a sign that said ""new born golden labs."" @CAPS1 was the perfect opportunity for us because we wanted a golden lab. We walked into the old fashion red barn and scoped out all the new puppies. But one caught my eye. this one ran up to me and gave a little high pitched bark that was unbearable to handle. I immediately said to my dad ""I want this one daddy."" @CAPS2 knew I connected with this dog. We surprised my mom with our new investment. She disliked dogs, but for some reason she connected with this one. What was most important to my mom was that @PERSON1 would always make me laugh, and when I was mad @CAPS2 would always cheer me up by licking me or just doing funny things. For an example I was mad because a friend couldn't come over. @CAPS2 jumped up on my bed with his chew toy and dropped @CAPS1 on my lap. I threw the toy and @CAPS1 landed right next to the wall. @CAPS2 ran after @CAPS1 like a cheetah on wheels and slammed right into the wall by the chew toy. @CAPS2 ran so fast that @CAPS2 couldn't stop right away. @CAPS1 made me crack up laughing and put me in a better mood. @CAPS2 was also special to us because of his nickname. His nickname was slobber dog because @CAPS2 would always have slobber flowing out of his mouth. That also made my family laugh.  Fourteen years later we find @ORGANIZATION1 still with us. @CAPS2 was @NUM1 years old in doggy years and about fifteen years old in human years. You don't realize how important something is until its gone. Sadly year after @CAPS2 passed away. @CAPS2 couldn't withstand the winter. @CAPS2 had no muscle to keep himself warm, and @CAPS2 would always shiver. @CAPS2 was a very happy dog, life was good for him. After @CAPS2 passed my dad and i where hurt because @CAPS2 was such an important miracle to us. We needed laughter in our lives to cheer us up and there was one special person to do that. My mom hated seeing us sad. My mom sat down with us and we all had a group discussion. She told us just to remember the good times. We talked about all the funny and good times we had with @PERSON1, which made us laugh and put us in a better mood. I then realized that @PERSON1 is in a better place and that @CAPS2 will be with us forever. After this experience I realized that laughter can do a lot of things to help people. @CAPS1 helped me cheer up from a loss that i would have never wanted to happen, and made me realize that @CAPS2 is in a better place.

137,21817,8," Do you ever laugh when your mad, sad or just because it's fun? Well I laugh constantly, In fact laughter plays a big role in my life. Even as my grades collide with football, and the time spent with my girlfriend isn't that long. I still find the time to put my worries behind me and laugh with my friends. I always enjoy hearing jokes and playing funny games because in my opinion laughter is what holds this crazy world together.  Laughter led to the most amazing relationship for me, with the girl I now call my girlfriend. No mater what we are doing or how we are feeling there's always room to throw a laugh around and lighten the mood. One thing I've lured in the months with this beautiful girl is that even in the most painful and stressful times you never know when its time to start laughing. Laughter also brought me closer to my dad in many occasions. My least favorite time of laughter was last month. My girlfriend and I where having a hard time dealing with stress and I thought the world was going to come crashing down on top of me. I was sure that nothing I said could ever revive her mood, until something extraordinary happened. I tripped over my shoe lace and implanted my face into the arm of her dads rusty, old, metal chair. Her laugh was so unpredictable and mean that I didn't know what to say. To this day I still don't know why she would laugh at me, but truthfully, I don't care because she was happy and full of joy.  My favorite time of laughter was about a year ago when we had an absolutely terrifying wind storm. The power was out and every thing in the freezer was going to though out if we didn't go turn the generator on. We needed to go out side under old oak trees that could plummet to the ground at any time and carry the three-hundred pound generator back to the garage. I sat and watched as the branches where flying through the air knowing if I got hit by one I'd be out cold. But i know if i did i could help save all the meat in the freezer. I got ready at the front door with my dad and then sprung from the door strait to the generator. As I was running I got hit by three twigs in my eye, cheek, and my ice cold ear. Once we made it to the garage safely I shut the door and waited for my dad to start the generator. I could see the relief in his face knowing that he did that with out dieing. After wards we went back into the house and sat down and out of nowhere my dad looked at me and started laughing. I couldn't help but to laugh too. Honestly, I don't know why it was my favorite time of laughter but it will always be deep in my memories. Most would agree that laughter is the ice to the worlds cream.

Well I laugh constantly, In fact laughter plays a big role in my life. Even as my grades collide with football, and the time spent with my girlfriend isn't that long. I still find the time to put my worries behind me and laugh with my friends. I always enjoy hearing jokes and playing funny games because in my opinion laughter is what holds this crazy world together. Laughter led to the most amazing relationship for me, with the girl I now call my girlfriend. No mater what we are doing or how we are feeling there's always room to throw a laugh around and lighten the mood. One thing I've lured in the months with this beautiful girl is that even in the most painful and stressful times you never know when its time to start laughing. Laughter also brought me closer to my dad in many occasions. My least favorite time of laughter was last month. My girlfriend and I where having a hard time dealing with stress and I thought the world was going to come crashing down on top of me. I was sure that nothing I said could ever revive her mood, until something extraordinary happened. I tripped over my shoe lace and implanted my face into the arm of her dads rusty, old, metal chair. Her laugh was so unpredictable and mean that I didn't know what to say. To this day I still don't know why she would laugh at me, but truthfully, I don't care because she was happy and full of joy. My favorite time of laughter was about a year ago when we had an absolutely terrifying wind storm. The power was out and every thing in the freezer was going to though out if we didn't go turn the generator on. We needed to go out side under old oak trees that could plummet to the ground at any time and carry the three-hundred pound generator back to the garage. I sat and watched as the branches where flying through the air knowing if I got hit by one I'd be out cold. But i know if i did i could help save all the meat in the freezer. I got ready at the front door with my dad and then sprung from the door strait to the generator. As I was running I got hit by three twigs in my eye, cheek, and my ice cold ear. Once we made it to the garage safely I shut the door and waited for my dad to start the generator. I could see the relief in his face knowing that he did that with out dieing. After wards we went back into the house and sat down and out of nowhere my dad looked at me and started laughing. I couldn't help but to laugh too. Honestly, I don't know why it was my favorite time of laughter but it will always be deep in my memories. Most would agree that laughter is the ice to the worlds cream.

138,21818,8," @CAPS1 camping story  @CAPS1 famiy and I had decided to go on a camping trip to @CAPS1 cabin. We had all figured that that a week there would be long enough. So the packing had began. We packed things such as cloths, food, games you know the usual camping suplies. @CAPS1 dad and I loaded the car by ourself's with no help from @CAPS1 two sisters. @CAPS1 dad and i had finally finished packing the car and off it was to elk city, witch is where the cabin is of cource.  The trip down there wasnt too bad. We made it to elk city in just an hour. When we got to the cabin there was no time for fulling around we got straight to seting up our things and putting everything we packed into the cabin. After a day of swiming and a day of fishing I started to get bord. I could tell everyone else was getting bord also just by the look on there faces. @CAPS1 dad had what he thought was a good idea to tell jokes but failed trying to tell them. The next step to stop this bordness was to make camp names. ""@CAPS2 a great idea"" said @CAPS1 dad. But if you know @CAPS1 family you know that if we come up with camp names they ar'nt going to be your everyday camp names. Just like how @CAPS1 camp name was sliver ass because of the fact that when i was fishing i slid down a wooden dock and happened to catch a sliver. Luckly for me it was easy to get out but boy did i get alot of crap about it.  @CAPS1 dad's was dingle berry because of one of the lame jokes that he told about dingle berry's. @CAPS1 oldest sister's camp name happened to be fat ass. I feel really bad about having to call her that camp name. It was the only camp name that we could think of for her. The main reason we gave her that camp name was because of how mad she would get over us calling her that.  The almost youngest, @CAPS1 sister that happens to be six minutes older than me. Her camp name was very special as some would say. It was camel toe because of the bathing suit that she wore the first day that we went swiming. @CAPS1 family and I all tryed to tell her that her bathing suit was to small but she just would'nt listen @CAPS2 why she got the name that she did.  Michelle ""camel toe"" as we would call her at the cabin really hated her camp name but so did everyone else. I think @CAPS2 why it was so much fun to make camp names. Camel toe, dingle berry, fat ass and myself sliver ass still tell this day laugh about this camping trip.

It all started on one @DATE2 day when my dad came home from work and put out the idea of camping, now i don't know about everyone else but i love camping and was excited and totally with him on the matter so we planned the day we were going to go and who was all going and what time we were going to head out on our adventure to the woods. now we decided we were going to leave that @DATE1 and that me, my dad, his girlfriend, and her two kids were going to be the ones that were going on the camping trip and that we were going to leave real early @DATE3 @TIME2.  Now come @DATE3 me and my dad got up real early like we had planned and we got all our camping gear out and got the car all loaded and were just waiting for his girlfriend and her kids to show up and as u all know waiting for a girl is not fun they take forever to do anything and they normally do it wrong so u wait all that time just to have to go back and fix whatever they did wrong. finally at about noon they showed up and we all left and headed on our way to the campsite which was about two hours away which made it even longer to start our adventure. by the time we got there it was around four o'clock in the @TIME1 and it was starting to get dark so we got camp set up and we got a fire going hung out for a @CAPS1 while then went to sleep.  The next @TIME2 when i woke up my dad and his girlfriend were asleep and just myself and her kids were up and since a stacked a lot of wood on the fire the night before it was still lit and since it was still going and we were hungry we decided we were going to roast marshmallows. now after i have already eating like five marshmallow i had to go to the bathroom so i asked my dads girlfriends son if he would keep an eye my marshmallow while i went to the bathroom and he said @PERSON1 and that it was no problem but obviously it was a problem because when i came back my marshmallow was on fire so i grabbed the stick and started shaking it to get it to go out and just when it was almost out the marshmallow came off the stick came back and stuck to my forehead so i ran and jumped in the freezing creek that was about twenty feet away.  About a half hour after the little incident happened and my dads girlfriends kids were done laughing my dad woke up and asked what was going on and why the hell it was so noisy when he turned his head towards the creek and seen me standing there constantly dipping my head in the water then he started to laugh to and asked what i was doing then when i looked up and he saw how my forehead was burned and how bad it was he then grabbed the first aid kit and and told me that he will doctor me up.  While he was doctoring me up he asked what happened and i told him then i said that i never wanna eat or be around marshmallows and fire again.

About a half hour after the little incident happened and my dads girlfriends kids were done laughing my dad woke up and asked what was going on and why the hell it was so noisy when he turned his head towards the creek and seen me standing there constantly dipping my head in the water then he started to laugh to and asked what i was doing then when i looked up and he saw how my forehead was burned and how bad it was he then grabbed the first aid kit and and told me that he will doctor me up. While he was doctoring me up he asked what happened and i told him then i said that i never wanna eat or be around marshmallows and fire again.","i am going to tell u about this one time when i was camping and a tragedy happened that i didn't think was to funny but everyone else around thought it was the funniest thing ever.

Without laughter, there would be less communication and less happiness. laughter makes friends, forms relationships and makes everyone happy. Making friends would be real hard without laughter because people do not want to be around others who are always serious. Almost all of my friends where made by laughter. On the first day of freshmen @DATE1, I had to stay after school and wait for a ride. While waiting a girl walked by and i said something funny to her and she laughed. She then sat down next to me on the bench and we talked for about a hour. The whole time we laughed and had a really good time. Sometimes, all it takes to make friends is to make them smile and laugh. Making friends with anyone is easy when there is laughter. You could tell a joke or just say something that is funny. I had an aerobics class at the beginning of this @DATE1 and I did not have any friends in that class so I had to make friend in order for this class to be a privilege and not a punishment. So I went up to this cute girl and I said something nice to her and she laughed. We then hung out every day in that class. Laughter builds bonds and makes friends forever.

142,21822,8," The most memorable time that laughter was a part of my life experience was when I met one of my cousins friend she was cute, nice body, really nice and had a great personality. But she was hard to get so my first thing was to get her to laugh @CAPS1 we went on a roller coaster in six flags an wen it stoped my leg was shaking because I am afraid of heights and she started laughing i got shy and didn't know what to do and the first thing I said was @CAPS1 that was fun wasn't it. She replied why are you shaking the ride already stoped an I said @CAPS1 its because I am sitting next to a beautiful girl she blushed an shrugged down and said your cute too. I said so do you want to get something to eat or do you want to get on more rides. She was shy so didn't really like making the decisions so I took her to eat at the court yard we started talking and she seemed to be laughing quite a lot because the jokes and story's I was telling her. I just waned to get her to talk and to feel good around me because I don't really like it wen a girl is shy. After that day I noticed that laughter was one way to get at girls from that day forward I would try to make any cute girl to laugh and tell them sweat things they want to hear you know like the song says ""I am a flirt an I really don't care I tell them women whatever they want hear."" @CAPS1 back to the story I am known for having a smile on my face all the time and making people laugh. Another funny thing was wen me, @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and @CAPS2 went camping we went on a hike and @CAPS2 waned to prove he was better then the guy from man vs wild so he started eating random plants and insects. Wen we got to this small pond her found deer droppings an he threw one in his mouth an we all gagged and laughed because he had a weird look on his face and he was running around looking for water or something to take the bad taste of his mouth. It was a fun and funny moment we will never forget that was a type of experience wen you meet up with does people again you can remind them about it and have a good laugh. Most people say we are stupid or dum but if they got to know us they will notice that we just like having fun and enjoy life wile we can. Many people need laughter in their life to enjoy it and in brace it. For example my dad and his brother didn't relay get along but on my @NUM1 birthday my uncle came over and I had my dad sit down and talk things out with him. Then wen I turned back and look at them I saw both of them laughing I though to myself what could they be laughing about. So I went over to were they were to see what was going on and they just told me that they fixed their differences and found out that it was some miss understanding from both of them but it was funny and made them laugh and up to this point they still talk about that time and laugh. As you can tell laughter is relay involved in my life i experience it every day its something you cannot avoid because with out it you wont enjoy life the same as living with out it. I like to sit back at times and talk to my friends about our past memory's that broth us all together because they were all funny. Sometimes it offends other people but it doesn't relay matter to us because to us it means having a good time and still being able to hang around with each other with no feelings hurt. I have learn to joke around with people who wont take it seriously or else they will end up mad or @MONTH1 be just would get sad depending on the topic or situation you are in. I could go on talking about all my experiences that involved a lot of laughter but I think some of the story's are not appropriate for this paper I am writing. But I also made a promise to some of the people that are involved that we would never mention it to someone that wasn't involved with it at the time.

We then left the @ORGANIZATION2 and made our way across the street to the @ORGANIZATION3 to get a bite to eat. @CAPS1 girlfriend was under @CAPS1 arm and @PERSON4 was under @PERSON3's arm as we strafe our way through the crowded streets. Darkness was brewing at that moment, as the girls began emptying all the salt and pepper shakers on the table. They raced each other to see whose would get empty first as the pepper burnt all of our eyes. @CAPS2 and I sat there in the @ORGANIZATION3 watching @PERSON1 and @PERSON4 shaking the salt and pepper onto the table. After @ORGANIZATION1 passed @CAPS2 got up to get out of the pepper cloud that shot pain into our eyes. I soon followed. Through all this @CAPS4 was all we could manage. The unbelief that struck @PERSON3 was amusing. I had a hard @ORGANIZATION1 comprehending that just happened when we left the condiments just sitting there. The parking lot is where we wound up @ORGANIZATION1 our hysterical behavior. Dancing took place and it set a romantic mood for both relationships. @CAPS2 and his girl did a little kissing and @PERSON1 and I did some dancing and talking. @ORGANIZATION2 was where @PERSON3 ride was coming and as mine. So when @ORGANIZATION1 struck to go home we ended at the place where we met to begin this great day. The dancing resulted in us getting close to each other on a person to person level. We all engaged @ORGANIZATION1 each other, and we all spent @ORGANIZATION1 together.

That day started us at a new. Which will go down to be remembered for the rest our @ORGANIZATION1 together. As for me and @PERSON3, we met the night before and now are the greatest of @ORGANIZATION1.

Soon we were joking around and laughing like nothing happened, and all the stress I had disappeared.  @CAPS1 and I were laughing so much that we were practically rolling on the floor for over half the game.

The most important time I can remember was when I was a freshman in high school. I was always in the middle of drama, I don't know why, but I was. I was sent to the principals office more times than I can remember for the same reason. I had a friend named @PERSON2 and she always brought out the worst in me. Whenever we would walk by this girl named @CAPS1, she would yell mean things to us. One day @PERSON2 decided to say something back, and before I knew it I was caught in the middle. I was trying my best to defend @PERSON2, but they were getting so close to each others faces, and I could no longer step between them. I was so afraid that they were going to fight and I was going to accidentally get caught in it. So I had one of my other friends get a teacher, and right before @PERSON1 pulled her fist back, a teacher sent us all to the office. We sat and talked to the principal for two periods, when he released us he made a rule that we were no longer aloud to talk to each other. So we all headed off to out classes, but the worst part was I had my next class with @PERSON1. We both went in the locker room completely silent and dressed down for @ORGANIZATION1. As the whole class walked into the gym I realized @PERSON1 and I had the same friends. So when we had to pick teams we were both on the same team. At fist it was extremely awkward, but after a while the game of soccer got interesting. Eventually @PERSON1 and I started to communicate about where we should stand and how embarrassing it would be to trip and @DATE1. Soon we were joking around and laughing like nothing happened, and all the stress I had disappeared. @CAPS1 and I were laughing so much that we were practically rolling on the floor for over half the game. When the game ended We strolled on into the girls locker room like we've been best friends for years. The only thing that still weighed on my mind was how I was going to get @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 to be friends again. So when the bell rang I met @PERSON2 at my locker and we walked over to @PERSON1. Just t break the ice between them, I brought up something funny that happened in @ORGANIZATION1 and we all started laughing. Even though @PERSON2 wasn't there, @PERSON1 and I explained everything to her. Sooner than I thought we were all friends again. When I went home that day I felt so much better than I did any day that week.

While most would believe it is the alarm clock blaring @NUM1 inches away from his ear, it was probably the sound of raining pelting his window like someone was spraying a fire hose right on the corner of the house he occupies, that woke him up that @TIME1. As any @DATE1 @TIME1 starts, he wakes up late and doesn't want to emerge from his bed. But he hear's the question he hear's every @TIME1, ""are you up yet?!"" asks his mom from the other side of the door, he quickly leaps from his be to the gorund and says ""yes"" in the fastest way possible. He rushes to the bathroom to get ready for what must be just another boring @DATE1. He finishes up and goes to his room, gets everything together and is about to leave, when he sees it. A small folded up piece of paper, nothing uncommon to find in his room, but this particular piece was a monologue he was suppose to perform for his second period. His second period is an acting two class, he likes the people, and the class. but there are two small problems with this class, one being that he never took acting one. The other being that he is uncomfortableperforming in front of groups of people. he quickly grabs the sheet and heads off to first period. He sits through class just waiting. He sees the students who volunteer for the front office come into his math class, as they do almost every class. He wishes the sheet was for him so he could leave his class, as he wishes everyday. Then the teacher looks over and he realizes that he doesnt actually want that note to be his, but of course it is. As it is being handed to him he thinks of every thing he has done wrong in the last few weeks trying to figure out what he did wrong. He doesnt have a clue for the rest of the period, he just waits for that bell, so he can go see what dumb thing he did has sealed his fate this rainy @TIME1.  As he waits for someone to come get him to discuss the sheet, his second period starts. Still worrying about the monologue he asks to postpone the sheet that called him to the office for just one more period. He rushes to class, being @NUM2 minutes late, to find out some depressing news. The teacher isnt there. Instead of performing his monologue he does thatre games. While he is nervous for the monologue he wants to get it over with so he can get better. Class rolls on as it always does, even without a teacher. I guess the students are really just that good. After half an hour, the teacher shows up from his doctor appointment. Monologues still go today, but theyre going to be in the audatorium, instead of in class. There is ten minutes to prepare. He goes to the hallway to practice before he has to perform. He repeats the monologue over and over, well at least the hard parts. Then of course a girl from class asks him to do it for her. She is extremely pretty, and of course way out of his league. He trys to shoo her away, but she is persistant. He finally does it for her, she gives him her honest opinion, which while helpful is sort of a deterrent. They end up just talking and conversing about things as from acting as possible. Ten minutes feels like an eternity. Then its time. He is not the first to preform. He watches the first two girls go and they both sing beautifully and act very confident. He realizes he is screwed. There is one person before him left. He memorizes the hard parts of the monologue. The last one to go preform before him is probably one of the hardest working people at being an actor that hes ever met. This guy has been in an acting class ever semester of every year. He trys hard, but sometimes he comes up a little short, but he trys. hs quickly ends, with the teacher wanting to work on him with is. Now its the final presenter with his monologue he will nervously preform. The piece is one of his favoorite comedians strand up jokes he does about how shakespeare sucks, which he believes is perffect for an acting class. He preforms it with a few mistakes, but nobody notices, until someone in the front row just starts busting out laughing at his jokes. He then realizes he can shoot out these jokes in a way mirroring the actual comedian's version of telling it. He gets a few critiques, but none that he cant fix before next time. After class a few people say he needs to try out for the play because of his performance, which he easily agrees to.

148,21830,8," @CAPS1 one laugh @CAPS1 one laugh is all my mom asked from me and my dad, yes laughing is a simple thing that everyone in the world does and everyone enjoys but for me and my dad laughing together will rarely happen and @CAPS2 it did happen it would be ""@CAPS3 milagro"" as my mom says.  This all changed when my mom decided to go to @LOCATION1 with my little brother to go see my grandpa because he was very ill and leave me and my dad to have some daughter/father bonding time.My mom was ecstatic about this idea because she thought that me and my dad would get along better, and maybe @CAPS1 maybe get that true laugh that came from our hearts that my mom wants.   I could see the happiness that was beaming on my beautiful mom's face, her face was bright and her black beading eyes @CAPS1 starring down @CAPS7 me and all i could think of saying was ""@CAPS4 mom. don't worry we'll be fine."" I wanted to make this all work out and show my mom that me and my dad could have a perfect relationship, but this was harder than i thought. We fought all the time and argued for any little thing and we were @CAPS1 two bombs ticking ready to @CAPS1 explode.  I would lie on my bed looking up @CAPS7 my cracked up white ceiling thinking of ways to apologize to my dad so everything would be @CAPS1 fine. I've always wanted one of those miraculous endings in those sad movies when the daughter was a rebel and the father was the nice guy and @CAPS7 the end of every and each of those movies they would become one more step closer and the father would give the daughter a hug that made her feel secure and that no one was going to hurt her. I think all along that's what i wanted, to receive that long hug from my dad to make me feel loved by him. Weeks passed and my mom wasn't coming back for another two weeks so i thought to myself, @CAPS2 my dad is not going to make the first move then i am! and that's exactly how it happened. I complimented my dad everyday and i know, it probably sounds silly but it worked for me.He didn't laugh but he did smile, his smile gave me satisfaction, it made me feel victorious when i saw that smile of his wrinkled up face and something told me that those smiles he flashed @CAPS7 me were coming from his heart. This all changed when we hit @DATE1, in @LOCATION2 it is said that once @CAPS5 hit a new year @CAPS5 get a new life and when @CAPS5 get that new life @CAPS5 receive a special gift. The gift of love.I personally didn't believe that, i thought how can @CAPS5 get a new life @CAPS2 @CAPS5 already made up your own?  But yes, i have to say this is true and i learned this with my dad. It was the a few days after new years everything was calm between us and we @CAPS1 talked about the basic things a daughter and a father could talk about school and what did I'd want to eat.Until one afternoon we were walking outside and it was pretty cold every time time i breathed out a slow and steady breath i felt that my breath would @CAPS1 freeze and fall into a million pieces. We walked started to walk towards my house and the unexpected happened, my dad said the words that I've been wanting to hear for over years""@CAPS5 know what, @CAPS5 mean the world to me and @CAPS5 will forever be my little princess @CAPS8 @CAPS2 @CAPS5 get old!""@CAPS7 that precise moment i didn't know either to cry or hug him, it was some what shocking for me.Could the thing that i was longing for for happen @CAPS7 this moment? and yes it did. I gave my dad a hug that felt that lasted for over an hour but actually, it was only one minute. But that minute was an eternity for me, i felt that safe with him i was a warmness in my heart and i knew we could over come anyone and anything.

150,21834,8," About @NUM1 years ago, my older brother and I had the house to ourselves for the weekend. Our parents had gone to @LOCATION1 for a wedding for one of my father's cousins. For my brother and I, parents being gone for the weekend, never meant wild parties with girls, friends, and loud music. But we still @CAPS7 some crazy things close to that, that we weren't normally allowed to do. We played guitar and drums past our curfew, had multiple friends over and stay the @TIME1 for video games and hanging out, and doing reckless activities outside. Like shooting our neighbors house with a sling shot, using eggs or paint-balls, or firing golf balls out of the backyard. In this case, we wanted to see how far we could hit golf balls out of the back yard using drivers. It was a warm @DATE1 day, and I could see that our neighbors front door, directly ahead of us, was wide open, probably to keep it cooler inside. I started, by smacking the first golf ball into a tree nearby, not making much distance for my brother to top. My brother isn't a small guy either. @CAPS6 is a muscle bound high school student, and if you give him a club, @CAPS6 could send a golf ball @NUM2 yards with ease, like @CAPS6 does at the driving range in @LOCATION2 when my father brings us there for fun. @CAPS6 set up his tee and put the golf ball in place. @CAPS6 stepped back, turned to me, and quoted a line from @ORGANIZATION1- ""@CAPS1 long, sucker."" @CAPS2 @CAPS6 stepped up, swung fast, and as the club made contact with the club, there was a sound like the snap of a bone, and the ball was gone. We watched as the white ball flew through the air, a little more than @NUM3 yards into the road, and bounce off the top of a moving car, and into our neighbors front door. The car could be heard swerving to a stop, as we ducked down and quickly went into our house. Through the open window, we heard our neighbor yelling from his front door, and cursing angrily. My brother and I began @CAPS8 at the amazing shot, and how crazy the chance of it happening was. About ten minutes later, my brother and I had settled down, and we heard a knock at the door. I answered it with him behind me. It was our neighbor. @CAPS6 was holding up the golf ball in one hand with the other hand raised and open, shouting ""@CAPS3, nay?!"" ""@CAPS4?"" I replied. ""@CAPS3, nay?!"" @CAPS6 shouted again, making my brother and I laugh at his language. ""@CAPS7 @CAPS10 hit this ball into me house?! @CAPS10 done broke my glass show case with all the rocks I've collected over the years! @CAPS3, nay? Yes or no?!' @CAPS8 really hard now, my brother finally took control, and calmed down, and said, ""I'm sorry @PERSON1, I wasn't intending on hitting the ball in that direction. I was trying to aim into the forest."" @CAPS9 down, the neighbor handed over the ball, and said ""@CAPS10 hit me house again, you can be sure, that you'll be paying for my show case you rotten kids."" @CAPS6 turned around and walked off back to his house, very angry, and my brother and I continued @CAPS8 about the how funny his voice and language sounded, and turned on the @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 to @CAPS12 a video game.",24834,42,34,732,3146,3.519125683,21.52941176, about years ago  my older brother and i had the house to ourselves for the weekend  our parents had gone to for a wedding for one of my father s cousins  for my brother and i  parents being gone for the weekend  never meant wild parties with girls  friends  and loud music  but we still some crazy things close to that  that we weren t normally allowed to do  we played guitar and drums past our curfew  had multiple friends over and stay the for video games and hanging out  and doing reckless activities outside  like shooting our neighbors house with a sling shot  using eggs or paint balls  or firing golf balls out of the backyard  in this case  we wanted to see how far we could hit golf balls out of the back yard using drivers  it was a warm day  and i could see that our neighbors front door  directly ahead of us  was wide open  probably to keep it cooler inside  i started  by smacking the first golf ball into a tree nearby  not making much distance for my brother to top  my brother isn t a small guy either  is a muscle bound high school student  and if you give him a club  could send a golf ball yards with ease  like does at the driving range in when my father brings us there for fun  set up his tee and put the golf ball in place  stepped back  turned to me  and quoted a line from   caps long  sucker   stepped up  swung fast  and as the club made contact with the club  there was a sound like the snap of a bone  and the ball was gone  we watched as the white ball flew through the air  a little more than yards into the road  and bounce off the top of a moving car  and into our neighbors front door  the car could be heard swerving to a stop  as we ducked down and quickly went into our house  through the open window  we heard our neighbor yelling from his front door  and cursing angrily  my brother and i began at the amazing shot  and how crazy the chance of it happening was  about ten minutes later  my brother and i had settled down  and we heard a knock at the door  i answered it with him behind me  it was our neighbor  was holding up the golf ball in one hand with the other hand raised and open  shouting   caps  nay      caps   i replied    caps  nay    shouted again  making my brother and i laugh at his language    caps hit this ball into me house   done broke my glass show case with all the rocks i ve collected over the years  nay  yes or no    really hard now  my brother finally took control  and calmed down  and said   i m sorry i wasn t intending on hitting the ball in that direction  i was trying to aim into the forest   down  the neighbor handed over the ball  and said   caps hit me house again  you can be sure  that you ll be paying for my show case you rotten kids   turned around and walked off back to his house  very angry  and my brother and i continued about the how funny his voice and language sounded  and turned on the to a video game ,674,73,86,126,31,36,27,72,3,"About @NUM1 years ago, my older brother and I had the house to ourselves for the weekend.

153,21837,8," Exactly what is laughter? Why do people laugh? As a sixteen year old girl I laugh a whole bunch but, why do I laugh I have always wondered why? Laughter is the most universal emotion. Babies laugh, elderly people laugh, and @CAPS4 do teens. People laugh when they are told funny jokes or stories. Laughter is shown even when you get hurt or when you witness somebody else getting hurt. I believe laughter is a huge element in our lives. @CAPS4 don't be uptight and have a laugh once in awhile, its good for you.  My mother went tumbling down. @CAPS2 all happened when my family went camping with a couple of friends. We had this beautiful campsite over looking a waterfall, plants and flowers surrounding us. There was only one default which was, the hill we had to climb to get to the water. The second day of our comping adventure was going great, until my mother came back with the water jug not paying attention she tries to run down the hill while talking. Everything went down hill from that literally. My mother tripped on a rock about the size of a babies fist, falling down on her knees while throwing the water jug up in the air. Sliding her whole body down the hill head first. The whole campsite starts laughing, everyone witnessed my mother falling on her face going down the hill. I never understood why people laughed when others get hurt. Maybe its because they know they aren't the ones getting hurt but, either way we laugh.  Don't you hate hitting your elbow? That's the worst, the pain just never stops, and @CAPS2 tingles your elbow down to your hand. No matter how hard you hit your elbow or you @MONTH1 call @CAPS2 your funny bone, you laugh don't you. I do, every time. Its a weird feeling but at the same time @CAPS2 hurts. I remember once, I was sitting in math class not really pay attention @CAPS4 I fount a magnet and @CAPS2 was really strong I clinched @CAPS2 to the table I was sitting at and I went to go pull @CAPS2 off. That's when @CAPS2 was stuck. I tried just sliding @CAPS2 down to loose some of the magnet but nothing worked. @CAPS4 that's when I had to take drastic measures, I grabbed the magnet with both hands and pulled. Have you ever done something and in the middle of doing @CAPS4, you just knew @CAPS2 was a bad idea? Well that happened to me, when I starting pulling on the magnet a light bulb hit me. I was going to regret this and of coarse I did, the magnet lost charge and my elbow went flying hitting my metal chair. I could feel the pulse in my elbow, @CAPS2 was a horrible pain in my arm. I started laughing but, this laugh wasn't like a ""ha-ha"" kinda of laugh @CAPS2 was like a laughing crying type. To think back I think I might have cried. @CAPS2 wasn't serious but I saw a tear. The class starting to notice what I have done. First my teacher told me I should have been paying attention to the lesson and not a magnet and this wouldn't have happened. I believe everything happens for a reason @CAPS4, I believe I had this terrible occurrence @CAPS4 I can write about @CAPS2 today. @CAPS2 was worth the pain and tear. At least I got a laugh out of @CAPS2. Watching television, I see a lot of commercials. My favorite commercial is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 commercial @CAPS2 make me laugh.

""@PERSON1 (I ring) the door bell but you didn't answer that's why I knocked"". Tell your friends, kids, or even your grandparents brothers, a joke today I bet you and the person you tell them to will laugh.

The class starting to notice what I have done. First my teacher told me I should have been paying attention to the lesson and not a magnet and this wouldn't have happened. I believe everything happens for a reason @CAPS4, I believe I had this terrible occurrence @CAPS4 I can write about @CAPS2 today. @CAPS2 was worth the pain and tear.

But okay the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 tells the joke, ""why did the chef get arrested?"" why, ""because he was caught beating an egg."" ""ha-ha"" get @CAPS2.

""@PERSON1 (I ring) the door bell but you didn't answer that's why I knocked"".

156,21841,8,"Last @DATE1 was one to remember, but one memory in particular stands out from all the rest. The sun was beginning to set over the distant mountains as me and my family piled into the large tan suburban my step dad had purchased the weak before. It was a nice car and as I got in I was careful not to drag my muddy shoos along the new carpet. The car was not completely new but the man who had owned it before kept it in tip top shape.  We where on our way to my ants house for dinner and a movie. @CAPS5 was suppose to be introducing my parents to a good friend of hers from collage. @CAPS5 was staying with her for a few days while her house was getting remodeled. I decided to bring a book to read just in case i got bored. Listening to grownups talk can get purity boring and i was not going to just sit around doing nothing. We pulled into the drive way and got out of the car. As we walked into the house we could smell my ants lasagna and her famous bread sticks in the oven. @CAPS5 always made lasagna when @CAPS5 wanted to show off. I walked in the house and went start for my favorite corner but someone was already sitting there. I stopped and looked at her. @CAPS5 was short with long blond hair and small square glasses. At first I didn't know what to think of her but I did know that I didn't like her sitting in my spot. I walked up slowly as @CAPS5 looked up from her book. Hello. ""@CAPS1,""@CAPS5 said. And looked back down at her book.  ""@CAPS2... @CAPS3 in my spot,""I said. @CAPS5 put her book down and looked at me. ""@CAPS3 names not on it,"" @CAPS5 said. ""@CAPS4,"" I said, ""the blanket @CAPS3 sitting on does have my name on it.""  @CAPS5 got to her knees and examined the blanket. Across the four large yellow squares was my name in blow letters. @CAPS5 got to her feet  ""@CAPS6 it looks like this really is @CAPS3 spot,"" @CAPS5 said. ""That's @CAPS7 ,"" I said. I like to sit here because its quiet and i can reed. If you scoot over i can sit beside you.  ""I think I can manage that,"" @CAPS5 said. @CAPS5 moved over and i sat down.We opened our books and began reading.

The sun was beginning to set over the distant mountains as me and my family piled into the large tan suburban my step dad had purchased the weak before. It was a nice car and as I got in I was careful not to drag my muddy shoos along the new carpet. The car was not completely new but the man who had owned it before kept it in tip top shape. We where on our way to my ants house for dinner and a movie. @CAPS5 was suppose to be introducing my parents to a good friend of hers from collage. @CAPS5 was staying with her for a few days while her house was getting remodeled. I decided to bring a book to read just in case i got bored. Listening to grownups talk can get purity boring and i was not going to just sit around doing nothing.

My favorite memory involves @PERSON2, also known as @ORGANIZATION1, a short, blond, intelligent @NUM1 year old girl who loved to read, write, and singing songs, often changing them to fit with our daily lifes. Christy, refereed to as @CAPS1 @CAPS2, is extremely tall with short brown hair. She is a @NUM2 year old who is outgoing and lots of fun, even though she was the leader to the crew girls. Another important person to this story is @PERSON3, @PERSON3 was the ""@CAPS3"" at camp for high school week. He is a short old man who was very awkward sitting around a table eating dinner with @NUM3 other girls. The last main @CAPS4 is me, @PERSON1, know at camp as @CAPS5. I'm a little shorter than average, with long brow hair. I'm very talkative and outgoing, I love to read and spend time with my family and friends.  At the beginning of each week the crew girls were all given a job. This particular week @ORGANIZATION1 and I were given the task of going and helping out at the high school camp. We, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I loved working at the high school camp it was so much fun. We were having a great time, spending hours singing songs while washing dishes, all by hand, having water fights around the house, riding in the back of the trailer from camp to camp, and other random jobs we were told to do. Such as washing cars to going on @CAPS8 runs. All in all this week was building great new memories with lots of fun and laughter.  Everything twisted about half way through the week. @DATE1 was not going as well as we expected. First off we were running late which crammed us for time the rest of the day. We all were stressed running around like chickens with our heads cut off, which is even harder to deal with, people running everywhere bumping into each other getting upset. Just crazy all around. Everyone needed to calm down or people could start getting in the way and getting hurt on accident. Another problem, or the first accident, was that @PERSON3 was stepping over the hitch and ripped his pants. This means we now need to go to his house and get him new pants before we drop off the food, which delayed us even more. @ORGANIZATION1 and I jump in the back of the trailer to make sure nothing goes wrong back there with the food. As we go up the hill we notice that the heater, which weighs about @NUM4 pounds, is loose and not hooked up like it is suppose to be. @ORGANIZATION1 and I have no idea what to do. Many thoughts went through our minds, what do we do about the food, how are we going to keep ourselves safe, should we jump out of the trailer, we were clueless on what to do. There was no way we could have contacted @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @PERSON3, and it would be about seven minutes until we stopped.  @PERSON3 decided to let us out at the high school camp before he went home to change his pants because he realized we were still crammed for time and neeed to drop off the food as soon as possible. As we unloaded the food @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was upset with us, she though she could trust us, she wondered why were we messing around with the heater, and told us we were lucky that almost all of the food was still edible. Finally when we got it all set out and got to sit down ourselves we told @CAPS1 @CAPS2 what happens and how we didn't undo the heater. She was super apologetic and was glad we were still here and figured out a way to keep us and the food safe. After this we were just living in the moment, and cherishing every second we had together. Laughing about all the good times we had this week and previous weeks. How glad we all were that we met and got to know each other.

It was so much fun and you would roost someone and they would get a little upset but then they would start to laugh and join in on the fun.

But the funniest part of that day was when @CAPS1 @CAPS2 thought he would come up a different side of the hill to cut us off and roost us well @CAPS1 brother and I knew where the sand was soft and where it was not, what happened will probably remind you of when, in cartoons something goes thru a wall and you can only see the outline of the person or object, well this was identical he tried to come up the hill and as he did the whole four wheeler and him went about six feet into the hill. @CAPS1 brother and I started laughing so hard that we fell off our four wheelers and they kept going so we had to chase them. After @CAPS1 @CAPS2 pulled the bike out and got back on he went slow the whole way back to the house. The next day we went out to a different part of the dunes, and this time we were kind of playing hide and seek tag (roost) and we were in a dirt/sand area and we were going really fast jumping through bushes over water on the four wheelers, well we got to a dead end and i spun around before @CAPS1 little brother got behind me then he tried, well that didn't work as well as he had intended on, the bike almost flipped but he managed to jump off and the bike landed back on it's wheels, now four wheelers are known to bog down and die when someone is not giving it any gas, well his did not it kept going so when i turned around to see what was going on all i seen was him being @NUM3 foot @NUM4 inches chasing after a big blue four wheeler. When we got back I had to tell everyone, ad of course he was no where to be found, after i got done everyone was silent like are you serious, then all of the sudden there was an up roar of laughter, food got spit out, soda came out people's noses, it was very amusing.

The next day we went out to a different part of the dunes, and this time we were kind of playing hide and seek tag (roost) and we were in a dirt/sand area and we were going really fast jumping through bushes over water on the four wheelers, well we got to a dead end and i spun around before @CAPS1 little brother got behind me then he tried, well that didn't work as well as he had intended on, the bike almost flipped but he managed to jump off and the bike landed back on it's wheels, now four wheelers are known to bog down and die when someone is not giving it any gas, well his did not it kept going so when i turned around to see what was going on all i seen was him being @NUM3 foot @NUM4 inches chasing after a big blue four wheeler. When we got back I had to tell everyone, ad of course he was no where to be found, after i got done everyone was silent like are you serious, then all of the sudden there was an up roar of laughter, food got spit out, soda came out people's noses, it was very amusing. I do not know @CAPS4 you can tell how important laughing is to @CAPS1 family and I but its a part of us laughing in @CAPS1 family is like a kid in a candy store, tey want what ever they can have well with us its kind of like that we want to laugh at whatever we possibly can, the way I look at it @CAPS4 you do not have a sense of humor and can laugh about stuff what do you have? really. A nice car, a big house with a pool, none of that matters @CAPS4 you cannot laugh and have fun no one will want to be around you, and when they are they will feel awfully akward. Laughing is not only good for you but its also quite the work out. I guess laughing can burn like @NUM3 calories depending on how hard you laugh and how long. I remeber cartoons about people loosing there laugh box, @CAPS4 that were ossible no one in @CAPS1 family would have one.

161,21850,8," There is always that laughter somewhere either with friends, grandparents, parents, well really anyone. You could laugh with anyone that's whats so great about laughing. For one example i could even laugh with the cashier lady in the store. Just because you do not know a person we all love to laugh. That's the joy of it all.  There are so many story's that were the funniest thing when i was a little kid. Everything was funny to me back then i really had a natural laugh back then. Now i am growing up and its just gone i feel as if i have to make my self laugh. Then again there is always that one thing that i laugh so hard at, at least once a week. I love to laugh its the best thing in the world to me.                                My friends and i love laughing i think that's what we are best at. If none of us are laughing at anything we know something is wrong. So this story was actually about @TIME1. It was me @LOCATION1@NUM1,and @CAPS1. We were all at my house hanging out and i asked @CAPS1 to pluck my eye brows. She had always done a good job for the whole year. This time i knew she was a little off but i didn't think anything of it. We all sitting there i was texting as she was doing my eye brows and she stops. Shes like um your eye brow just got really short. I was not paying that much attention so i did not understand what she was talking about. I got up and i turned to everyone and they just started busting up laughing. I just sat there for a min as they laughed for like @NUM2 min straight. Finally i got up and looked in the mirror. My eye brow was about three inches long. All i could do was laugh it was a never ending thing. Then i got mad, i said that they were all jerks and they better fix it. As i was laughing i just forgot about it, then all of us started laughing at each other so it like a battle for laughing.  At this point i was sitting there texting my brother and telling him what had happen. He told me ""ha ha loser"", we do that to each other all the time. Then out of no where i remembered when i was about @NUM3 years old i shaved off my eye brows it was so bad. My brother made fun of me so much and we just laughed so hard. Which always makes me laugh, also so did my aunt she made fun of me to. I learned my lesson. I am never doing that again it was to humiliating. Good thing i was @NUM3 and not any older, after this happened my eye brow did not grow in for a long time.  All i do is laugh not so much now as before but its just not normal not to laugh. Every one has to laugh its like the joy coming out of you. My family likes to say that i always had the same laugh every since i was little. All my friends say that i sound like a little kid when i laugh. Maybe i just never grew out of my old laugh. The weird thing about laughing though to me is that i have a lot of different laughs. It all depends on what mood i am in.  Laughing is something that everyone does even a baby. Its a natural beautiful thing to life i honestly think. I got half my eye brow gone but instead of freaking out about it i laughed. That was a best friend moment so i always make sure to live my life to the fullest. I am always going to need laughter in my life. Laughing brings people together ans closer. There are so many memories with laughter in them that's what make them the memories.

164,21856,8,"      An @CAPS1 @CAPS2   @CAPS3 was a dark and foggy @CAPS2, my friend @CAPS4 and I were at youth group and we had just finished playing the ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"". The @CAPS5 @CAPS6 is like hardcore musical chairs, you get everyone to hold hands around three chairs placed in the middle of the room and the objective is to make the other players run into the chairs. If someone touches one of them, @CAPS16're out, and the last one standing wins. We had just finished our third @CAPS6 and @CAPS3 was time to go home because my youth pastor, @PERSON1, wanted to go and was locking up the church. So we said good bye to him and started walking home. We didn't live very far from the church, I lived about five blocks away and @CAPS4 lived three blocks away. @CAPS3 was still warm even though @CAPS3 was in the late fall and foggy. We were talking about guitars as we walked. We were walking slowly so that we could talk longer. @CAPS3 was time to say good bye to @CAPS4 and I would have to walk the rest of the way home. I said ""@CAPS9 ya man"". He replied"" @CAPS9 ya, have a good @CAPS2"". As @CAPS4 was saying this, a car drove by on the road parallel to the one that we were on and slowed down and looked at us for a second then turned on its blinker to turn up ahead onto the road I would be on in a minute. I said ""That's weird"" to @CAPS4 but he was already inside. So I hid under his dads truck, just in case. Just as I had gotten under the truck the car turned the corner. There @CAPS3 was, sitting at the end of the street. The only movement was the fog rolling slowly across the beam of the head lights that seemed to be scanning the street for movement, like a beast stalking its prey. The only noise I could hear was the engines menacing drone. I was frozen like a statue, afraid @CAPS3 would @CAPS9 me if I moved. @CAPS3 slowly started to move forward, seeming to be double checking everything to @CAPS9 if @CAPS9 if I was there. Then @CAPS3 came to a stop at the intersection, no stop sign, no red light, no reason to stop at all. There I lay, frozen, my heart sounded like a drum, pounding in my head. Adrenaline pumping through my veins. Minutes seemed to be hours as the car sat within reach of me, sitting at the intersection.  Then, @CAPS3 slowly left, seeming to be confused and disappointed that @CAPS3 didn't find me. I waited until I knew @CAPS3 was gone for sure. Then I raced as fast as I could the rest of the way home, never looking back. Every muscle in my body throbbing, my blood pulsing through my body, every ounce of will and strength pushed for one goal. To make @CAPS3 home. I sped down my driveway opened the door to my house and dove in. Then a calm came over me, my heart slowed down, I was relived that I was still alive.

Sometimes people laugh at really stupid things. This is one of those cases. One night me and my friend @ORGANIZATION1 went to @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2 for some food and when we were done we went to @ORGANIZATION1's house for the night. It was a good day for us so we were laughing a lot that day, sometimes it was at little things that didn't even matter. To me @ORGANIZATION1 was hilarious that night.

It was a disgusting taste.  I look on the ground and I see @ORGANIZATION1 just spraying the body spray and laughing. Her laughter got interrupted by her coughing. Her coughing sounded like a dog choking. She continued to cough on the smell of body spray for a minute or two then her coughing turned into laughter. Her laugh sounded like a hyena, not an ordinary hyena either, it sounded like a wild hyena. Then she started rolling on the floor continuing her hyena laugh for a couple of minutes. The room became very quiet then, not an ordinary quiet, it was more of an eerie quiet. The eerie quiet made me a little frightened for what was going to happen next. All of a sudden the eerie quiet ended with @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""@CAPS2,"" and walking out of the room. I started laughing so hard at that, I couldn't control my laughter. @ORGANIZATION1 came back into the room with food and asked me why I was laughing so hard. I told her what happened and she didn't remember doing that. She started laughing and then I started laughing.  It felt like we were laughing for days.

Well I believe that is very true because it helped my best friend @PERSON1 once when she came over and she was not in the greatetest mood. So I thought I would cheer up and make her laugh and smile and get whatever it was that was bothering her off her mind. So we watched some @CAPS1.V. and had a few laughs at that. Then we went outside to go for a walk and play in the snow. While we were on this walk we almost fell over a lot of times because it was also slippery outside too!

It happened so quick I didn'@CAPS1 realized what had happened until we was on the ground in the cold cold snow. That was a very painful fall that it made @PERSON1 and I laugh very hard.

We get back to my house,go inside take our wet shoes off by the door and then stand by the fireplace to warm our bodies up. About @NUM1 minutes we was standing there and @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS2 man, my socks are all wet!"" We laugh again.  I tell her it's fine I'll let you borrow a pair of mine.

Then I asked her if she was happier than when she first got to my house? She replys, yes @CAPS3 thank you! I tell her no need to thank me im your best friend it's what I'm here for. Everyone needs laughter to help make them feel better, and so that's what I did. Then we went into the k itchen and made some cookies and brownies to eat.They were delicious, @LOCATION1 and I had so much fun make them that we lost track of how much we had made. So far we had made two dozens of cookies and one dozen of brownies, we laughed. Good thing we had my grandma and two brothers to help us eat them. So we shared with them and they all enjoy them so glad we had extra of them! Over all this story certainly proves that laughter helps put you in a better mood, like I did for my best friend @PERSON1.

Then I asked her if she was happier than when she first got to my house? She replys, yes @CAPS3 thank you! I tell her no need to thank me im your best friend it's what I'm here for. Everyone needs laughter to help make them feel better, and so that's what I did. Then we went into the k itchen and made some cookies and brownies to eat.They were delicious, @LOCATION1 and I had so much fun make them that we lost track of how much we had made. So far we had made two dozens of cookies and one dozen of brownies, we laughed. Good thing we had my grandma and two brothers to help us eat them. So we shared with them and they all enjoy them so glad we had extra of them! Over all this story certainly proves that laughter helps put you in a better mood, like I did for my best friend @PERSON1.

I can certainly say that laughing puts everyone in a great mood.","So some people say laughter helps put you in a better mood right? Yes. Well I believe that is very true because it helped my best friend @PERSON1 once when she came over and she was not in the greatetest mood. So I thought I would cheer up and make her laugh and smile and get whatever it was that was bothering her off her mind. So we watched some @CAPS1.V. and had a few laughs at that. Then we went outside to go for a walk and play in the snow. While we were on this walk we almost fell over a lot of times because it was also slippery outside too! It was funny because everytime one of us almost fell we'd grab on to each other to help us keep out balance, but one time she grabbed me off guard and we both fell. It happened so quick I didn'@CAPS1 realized what had happened until we was on the ground in the cold cold snow. That was a very painful fall that it made @PERSON1 and I laugh very hard. So after we fell over and had our laugh,we got up and brushed ourselves off and made our way back to my house. We get back to my house,go inside take our wet shoes off by the door and then stand by the fireplace to warm our bodies up.

For me a smile is an adventure, people smile and laugh all over the world there's no place where you can't find a smile. A simple smile started a adventure for me. It all started with a smile him at the lunch table in the cafeteria sitting with his friends. And me at the table next to his with my friends. My friends and I were done with our lunch we left outside for a walk. While we were walking somebody came and push me and I almost felt into a spill of a nasty looking chocolate milk. My friend @PERSON2 grab me just in time. It was embarrassing I had everybody's eyes on me.  The next day I was running down the hall to biology, I didn't wanted to be late for class I had a presentation to do. I walk in to class and when I sat down I saw him, talking to my friend @CAPS1. I got so nervous, he couldn't stop looking at me so I smile, the next thing you know he is walking towards me. I had no idea of what to do I stand up and walk towards my friend @CAPS2, I turn around and see him leaving. As soon as he walk out the door I go rushing to @CAPS1 and asked him questions. As soon as class was over @CAPS1 came and talk to me, he told me that his name is @PERSON3 that he has know him for a while. I was shocked, I didn't know what to say just walk away. When I got home I was so happy that even my sister got surprise. She came up to me and told me if I was doing drugs or anything like that. I smile and said no, that I just had a happy day at school. She wanted to know what was up, but I knew she was going to tell my parents if I had told her anything. I just couldn't wait for school tomorrow. The next day at lunch, I went for a walk with my friend @CAPS5 when we were entering the building I saw @PERSON3 with @CAPS1 I got nervous, @CAPS5 notice, she just started laughing. When we walk past them when we were about to open the door, I heard somebody call my name.When I turn back I saw it was @PERSON3 who called me. I couldn't believe that he was actually talking to me. We went for a walk we got to know each other. When the bell rang he walk me to my class. At class my friend @PERSON2 saw me talking to him, she wanted to know everything, since @PERSON2 is like a sister to me I told her everything. Days past an at every lunch I spend with him he would always make me laugh. I had a good time with him. One day he ask me out, and we started dating. I was extremely happy. When I told my friends, they were happy that I was going out with somebody. After several days my friends change their opinion about @PERSON3.I didn't understand why they change their mind about him so fast. After a while @PERSON2 told me that she change her mind because she found out that he was a bad guy. I didn't believe her, I had a good time with him. He would make me forget about my problems. She said I was crazy for still dating him I didn't care what she think. Some days past he stop coming to school I wonder what was wrong. I ask his uncle @PERSON4 and his niece @CAPS8, but they wouldn't tell me anything. Until I finally talk to his sister @PERSON1. She told me he was on house arrest I couldn't believe it. When I finally got to talk to him he explain it all. When he came back we were back to having a good time. I always felt conferable been with him. I was leaving to @LOCATION1 for winter break.. I wasn't going to see @PERSON3 for a while. Days past and he stop showing up for school I wasn't sure if I wanted to know what was going on this time. One morning @PERSON4 give me a phone number, he told me to call it I found out it was @PERSON3. After a while he called an broke up with me for no reason. I decide to have fun with my friends at school and forget about him. Well my ending with @PERSON3 wasn't happy. But it all started with a smile. And from that smile a adventure happen.

168,21860,8,"People have a lot of sayings about laughter. Usually, this sayings express the importance of laughter as a part of human's life. People in @LOCATION1 believe, that he who laughs a lot is getting extra time of a life. Despite I don't know for how much every minute of laughing extends my life, I am pretty sure, that I will never die.The gloominess was attacking me severely from the very beginning of the @DATE2. Being an exchange in a state with a climate totally opposite to the climate in your native country was challenge-full. Every time when it was rainy-and it is rainy in @LOCATION2 almost all the time-I would get upset and start missing sunshine. I didn't want to talk to people at all-everyone seemed unattractive and boring, so I literally hadn't anyone to talk with. I had started to count days till @DATE1 hoping it would had been snowy-but @NUM1 wasn't snowy as I expected. It was rainy. Rain, rain, rain, every day. After several month of staying in @LOCATION2 I suddenly realized that I didn't have friends. I partly knew, that not only the weather affects my life, and that I should have spoken and smiled to people. But I didn't used to it! Fortunately, one day everything changed. One my classmate invited me for her birthday party. I didn't know her very well, but I really wanted to go-why not? I knew that I shouldn't have missed possibility to have fun at the party with other kids. When I came to the party I saw some people who I knew before from school and some who I had never seen before. I started panicking, because I got used to get confused in a company of people who I don't know. Party was going on and on, we started to play some games which I've never played before. I wasn't really very interested in a participation or winning, so I was just sitting and staring at somebody's silly drawing on a piece of paper. Suddenly that guy, who was sitting next to me, randomly pointed on it and started to laugh, so loudly, candidly and - and something else, what made me want to laugh, so I looked at the picture with this drawing of funny face! It was the funniest thing which I had ever seen. So I exploded with this laughter. I just randomly found somebody's picture entertaining. I was kind of feeling uncomfortable in a first second afterward, but other people payed attention at the picture and they actually started to laugh too! After that I felt like I was set free. I knew all the people at the party-we played lots of games, and they were entertaining and really interesting. I couldn't stop joking and everyone laughed at my jokes. Oh, and I got acquainted with the laughing guy- he was a really nice person, and now he is one of my best friends.I can't say that if you laugh once it would make you super-self-confident, would instantly give you million friends or would give you the best job ever.

I knew that I shouldn't have missed possibility to have fun at the party with other kids. When I came to the party I saw some people who I knew before from school and some who I had never seen before. I started panicking, because I got used to get confused in a company of people who I don't know. Party was going on and on, we started to play some games which I've never played before. I wasn't really very interested in a participation or winning, so I was just sitting and staring at somebody's silly drawing on a piece of paper. Suddenly that guy, who was sitting next to me, randomly pointed on it and started to laugh, so loudly, candidly and - and something else, what made me want to laugh, so I looked at the picture with this drawing of funny face! It was the funniest thing which I had ever seen. So I exploded with this laughter. I just randomly found somebody's picture entertaining. I was kind of feeling uncomfortable in a first second afterward, but other people payed attention at the picture and they actually started to laugh too! After that I felt like I was set free. I knew all the people at the party-we played lots of games, and they were entertaining and really interesting. I couldn't stop joking and everyone laughed at my jokes. Oh, and I got acquainted with the laughing guy- he was a really nice person, and now he is one of my best friends.I can't say that if you laugh once it would make you super-self-confident, would instantly give you million friends or would give you the best job ever.

One can tell when a person has not had a good laugh for a while. You can @CAPS16 @CAPS5 expression on their face, it looks as if life had just drained from them. I believe that the statement, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" to be true. Laughter can connect two people, even a group of people, fast. Not only is laughter enjoyable, it is also healthy for you. It is able to relive a person from stress and depression. Here is a story about @CAPS10 a little laughter can go a long way. It was her first day of high school. @CAPS2 was so excited. As @CAPS2 stepped out on the high school pavement, @CAPS2 felt a sense of importance for @CAPS2 wasn't in junior high any more. @CAPS2 was speed walking through the halls, trying not to be late for her first class of the day. @CAPS2 noticed all of the other students with their brand new school outfits and with their shiny new shoes. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS2 thought ""they look so cool, i want to be like them."" @CAPS2 looked down at her torn jeans and her scratched up shoes. Forgetting @CAPS2 had classes in less than a minute, @CAPS2 hurried and ran to her first class. ""@CAPS3!"" The bell startled her as @CAPS2 was doodling on her paper while the teacher was lecturing about something of the geography of @LOCATION1. @CAPS2 quickly crammed all her books and notes into her backpack and followed the rest of her peers out the door. Lunch time. This was the students favorite part of the day. As @CAPS2 entered the cafeteria it reminded her of a shopping mall with people running around everywhere. The geeks, the jocks , the skaters, @CAPS9 had their own table with their own group of friends except one person. @CAPS2 was standing there looking out. ""@CAPS4 I should just go eat in the hallway."" @CAPS2 thought to herself. As @CAPS2 turned around @CAPS2 thought once again, ""@CAPS5, if I'm going to be here I'm going to need to make some friends."" @CAPS2 entered out into the lunch room with full confidence, @CAPS5 one was going to stop her. @CAPS2 walked around from table to table. @CAPS5 one even noticed her, as if @CAPS2 were a ghost. @CAPS2 finally reached the back table and saw a boy, sitting all by himself, eating lunch. Before @CAPS2 could even think, @CAPS2 sat down and started a random conversation with the boy. @CAPS11 looked up bewildered. As @CAPS2 stopped talking, @CAPS11 looked up at her and said, ""@CAPS7 are you talking to me, don't you know who I am?"" @CAPS2 looked at him with a blank face. ""@CAPS9 thinks I'm trash, I'm not worth anything. @CAPS7 even bother sitting with me and pretending you're my friend?"" @CAPS11 stated. Her heart sank all the way to the floor. @CAPS2 had pity for him.""@CAPS10 could someone treat you like this? They have @CAPS5 right."" @CAPS11 looked at her as if that was the first time any one had ever said any thing like that to him. @CAPS2 began to talk to him more. Everyday @CAPS2 would sit next to him at the lunch table and @CAPS5 one would even bother to look down and say, ""@CAPS12!"" One day as they were eating lunch together, @CAPS2 turned to him and said,""I was just thinking, I have never heard you laugh before."" ""Is that a bad thing?"" @CAPS11 said with confusion. ""@CAPS7 @CAPS17! @CAPS9 needs a good laugh."" @CAPS2 said.As they began to talk more, the boy told the girl that @CAPS11 has had @CAPS5 reason to laugh. His family is broken, @CAPS11 has @CAPS5 friends, and the teachers hate him. In fact, @CAPS11 couldn't even remember the last time @CAPS11 had a good laugh. ""@CAPS14,"" @CAPS2 stood up boldly, ""I will help you laugh."" @CAPS11 chuckled at her.""@CAPS16!"" @CAPS2 shouted. ""That doesn't count!"" @CAPS11 yelled back.""@CAPS17 it does. Even a little chuckle can lead to a big hearty laugh."" @CAPS2 stated. The next day at the lunch table @CAPS2 noticed something was different about the boy, something had changed. As @CAPS2 drew closer @CAPS2 noticed a big smile across his face. ""I haven't been this happy in a long time!"", @CAPS11 said with his eyes beaming.

173,21866,8," A true story in which laughter was an element was when I was on the run. I know what you would be thinking that being on the run is no laughing matter. In my case I pictured it differently.When I ran I did not know anybody in this town which was called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The day I ran I met a guy named @CAPS3.I sat down behind @ORGANIZATION1 and drank some wine with him. We started talking and I told him what my situation was like and he told me his friend @PERSON4 has a place open for me to stay at. I thanked him for his help and met up with his friend @PERSON4. He was a nice guy and the place that was open was his friends place where @PERSON5 and @PERSON3 were staying. They let me into their house without any questions asked and I am very gratefu for that. That night we had an airsoft war out in front of their house.We all had lots of welts from the plastic pellets. The next day when I woke up @PERSON5 said he was going to stop by his mother's house. I went with them and found out his mother lived on @LOCATION1 street. His mother's name was @PERSON2 but she goes by @CAPS4. While I was there I met her roommate @PERSON1.He was a slob so I didn't think much about him. There was a girl there around my age that was just visiting her name was @CAPS5. I ended up having a relationship with her later on but it only lasted a couple of weeks. I got to know @CAPS4 better during the next couple of weeks and to my surprise one day she asked if she could adopt me!

Laughter can overcome anger and break the tension among two people. "" Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". @ORGANIZATION1 was the @ORGANIZATION1 i attended in @NUM1 grade. My classmates and I have memories of funny and unforgettable situations where we were constantly laughing out loud, I personally have memories i will never forget. Everyday my friends and I would play @NUM2 on @NUM2 basketball during lunch.

One day, it was a @DATE1, my teacher gave me lunch detention for a stupid reason and until this day i still don't have a clue why. Anyways, in our @ORGANIZATION1 we have a specific place we had to go for lunch detention, and it was called @LOCATION1S which stands for In @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1. It was @CAPS2 @NUM5, lunch had barely started and on my way to @LOCATION1S i noticed a girl crying her eyes out as she was basically sprinting towards the bathrooms. I later found out her name was @PERSON1. I got to @LOCATION1S, sat down, and started thinking why she was crying. I was curious. @PERSON1 walks in and sits down right across from me. Her eyes were red and she was holding multiple tissues in her hand. At first there was an awkward silence in the room, but out of no where she turns @CAPS2 and said "" can i borrow your pencil"". She had the sweetest most angelic voice @CAPS3 ever heard, and for a split second i thought she was an angel. With out any regards I immediately said yes, I mean she was very attractive. Than she said with her angelic voice "" thank you very much"". I was melting inside. Without any other words I sat in silenced as she was using my pencil. Lunch was over, she returned my pencil without saying anything, just a smile and walked of.  The next day I really wanted to see her and talk to her, so between my classes i would walk @CAPS2 the hall ways and peak in every room just to find her. I was so desperate to see her that i purposely told the teacher to shut up, knowing i would get a lunch detention. And of course, I did.  Lunch came, and i was never excited to go to detention until that day. I arrived at @LOCATION1S @NUM6 minutes early, i sat down just staring at the door waiting for @PERSON1 to walk in.

176,21869,8," Losing a friend is hard, but losing a best friend because of a boy is even harder. My best friend, @PERSON2, and I fought most of our seventh grade year, because of a boy that we were in love with. @PERSON1 was tall, blond, funny, and cute. The guy almost every girl was in love with and most of the guys didn't like. He was in my shop and art classes, and sat with me a lot. I talked about him all the time and @PERSON2 didn't know who he was, so one morning at breakfast, i decided to show her who he was. She thought he was cute, too. @PERSON1 and I started talking a lot and we became friends. I told @PERSON2 that I liked him, and she told me to go for it. So I did. A few days after I got rejected, he asked @PERSON2 out. She said yes. I was so mad, but I tried not to show it. I told her I liked him, and then she started dating him. It hurt and I didn't understand why she would do that to me.  After that, she became my friend and @PERSON1 became my best friend. I got used to the fact that they were dating, but it still bothered me and made me mad when they would hug in front of me or when @PERSON1 would tell me the kissed. They were together for four or five months. They got into an argument and broke up. They were always fighting. Two day's later, he asked me out and I said yes. I was so happy and everyone told me that we made a better couple than him and @PERSON2 did and that made me happy, because we trusted and knew each other @PERCENT1. Him and @PERSON2 weren't like that at all. She always tried to change him. I never did, because I liked him the way he was. @PERSON1 and I walked to lunch holding hands, so people knew we were together. When we sat down, @PERSON2 wasn't there. I got up to look for her, and when I found her, she wouldn't even look at me. We started fighting, and I didn't understand what the big problem was. I knew him and liked him before @PERSON2 did, so I thought I deserved a chance to be with him. I walked away from her because she wouldn't let me explain anything, it was frustrating, and I thought I was going to punch her.  @PERSON1 and I were off and on for a couple months, and everything between me and @PERSON2 was good again. The last time @PERSON1 and I broke up, was the worst. We fought everyday. @PERSON2 started dating him a few day's after we broke up that last time. I was so mad. Her and I fought all the time again. I still rode home with her, still got a ride to the bus stop with her, but we never talked. one day we were riding back to our houses and I said something funny and she laughed. Then I laughed, and we couldn't stop laughing. We became friends again. We made a promise that it wouldn't happen ever again. Laughing makes everything better; especially when your sad. Whenever @PERSON2 and I hang out, we never stop laughing. I can't believe we fought over a stupid boy, that we both don't talk to that much anymore. It makes me laugh just thinking about it.

177,21870,8," I @MONTH1 not be the funniest person alive, but I have the occasional big laugh. I am the kind of guy who is funny randomly without trying, and then when i try to be funny I stink terribly at it. My friends and I love to joke around with each other. All day we sit around and laugh our butts off, Laughter is a key element in all of our relationships, at least I know it is in mine. My friends and I have this little thing we do, a ritual I guess @CAPS2 can call it. Every weekend after a game we drive into town and go to @ORGANIZATION2. Once we are done at @ORGANIZATION2's we go to @ORGANIZATION1 and each of us buys one of these cheap @MONEY1 two liter pops. We drive out of town onto one of the back roads and chug it, this thing we do is called the ""@NUM1-liter @CAPS1."" The objective in this is to completely drink your two liter of pop and throw up first. This @MONTH1 seem easy, but it is actually very hard, the carbonation fills up your stomach like a balloon until it finally has to come out somewhere. Doing this is really quite pointless considering that @CAPS2 don't really win anything, but it is very funny to watch other people throw up when or even before they are done drinking their pop. This all started when we saw a video of someone doing it on @CAPS2-tube, we loved it and decided to to try it and we also created a video. It's always a good laugh. Me and my friends are not really all that much the same, they are more the athletic cool kids and I guess I am more of the smart kid who just follows them around. Really one of the only things we share is our sense of humor, the smallest thing we think is funny and we will laugh about it all day. It is surprising how laughter can bring completely opposite people together. At the best and worst of times having a good laugh with your friends or with anyone can always bring a smile. My friends are some of the best and funniest people I know, just five minutes with them and I can guarantee a smile. I don't know what I would do without them, I don't know if I would have been able to make it through these past couple of years without them. Five years ago or so my parents got into a divorce, life then and even life now has been difficult. Your home is supposed to be your safe place to go when @CAPS2 are having a rough time, when @CAPS2 have the whole world on your back. It should be the place where none of your problems matter.

We could only imagine the boys laughing and making fun of us at this point. Now after the water balloon fight, which was years ago, we look back at that day and realize that that's the day where our friendship began. If they wouldn't have thrown the balloon we would not be friends.

Together we have seen each other through our parent's divorces, deaths of family members, and the everyday trials and tribulations of growing up. We have cried, danced, sang, and played with each other. But most of all, we have laughed. Our laughter has been heard throughout the land: from the many houses I have lived in, and the few she has inhabited; all across @LOCATION2- from coast to desert; not to mention the times we have giggled in other states. For this, and many other reasons, she is my best friend. If I were to attempt to speak of all the wondrous times I have had in her company, the resulting novel would be longer than a multi-volume encyclopedia. So I will instead write about just a few excellent experiences, each one filled with its own unique, boisterous laughter.  When we were younger, most likely about eight years old, @PERSON1 and I used to run away. Not because we had particularly difficult childhoods or troubled households, but simply because we wanted to try living by ourselves. So we would cram our wee bags full of the objects we could not survive without. These packs of necessities included: our favorite stuffed animals, blankets and pillows, games we enjoyed, flashlights, umbrellas, and usually some delectable treats. We gathered it all up, stuffed it into my big red wagon, secured it with a jump rope, and set of into the world. On occasion we brought my little brother, @PERSON2, along for the ride. He would normally be squished into the wagon with all the equipment. Though we never traversed any farther than the field at the end my street, we always had a marvelous time- even if it was rainy or cold. And all the while we would laugh. We would snicker conspiratorially as we stole outside, laugh out loud as we went down the block, and giggle nervously as night began to fall. Before a few hours had passed we would be safely wrapped in the warmth of our cozy home, but those hours were exciting times when we proved that we could survive outside societies standards. @PERSON1 and I reestablish that we have no need for society when we go on our annual ""dads and kids"" camping trip. Though the number of participants and the exact location has changed over the @DATE1 seven years, the basic format has stayed constant. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, our fathers, and I fill two cars with gear and drive to the @LOCATION2 coast. Once there we spend most of our time at the campsite, hearing the same campfire stories, making s'mores, swiming in the river, and rafting to the @LOCATION1. But @DATE1 was a bit different. Instead of heading west towards the water, we went east to the peaks; eventually ending up at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. And it is absolutely dazzling there: fresh mountain air, twenty minutes from @ORGANIZATION1, and the @CAPS2 is so beautifully transparent that the bottom is easily visible all the way in the middle.

Consequently, it takes a bit of time to become acclimated while swimming in the frigid water. Regardless, we still have a phenomenal time, and now consider ourselves experts at setting up tents.  But despite our tough survivor girl exteriors, @PERSON1 and I are quite desperately dependent on the technologies of the day. Together we have watched countless television shows on @ORGANIZATION2, listened to heaps of songs on @CAPS3, and even made a few movies ourselves on iMovie. For example, I remember the first ""full length"" (and by that I mean five minutes long) movie we collaborated on. It is called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"", and though it has almost no plot, it was stunningly fun to create. We were about ten years old and we knew, unequivocally, that we wanted to be famous in the film business when we grew up. So we thought and we brainstormed until we finally came up with an idea. Though it @MONTH1 not have been the most brilliant idea out there, it was ours. Two ordinary citizens (masterfully portrayed by @PERSON2 and @PERSON1) were having an argument over which came first: peace and war, or love and hate. A huge battle erupted, consisting of first hours, then days, and eventually weeks of pillow fighting! It felt as if it would go on forever, until @CAPS4 @CAPS5 steps in to save the day! In the end the bloopers were longer than the story itself, but we still go into hysterics every time we watch the film. It is a source of entertainment we shall never forget.  I suppose I have now managed to condense one of my most important relationships into four measly paragraphs. I spoke of the laughter we have shared: hushed, thunderous, timid, and unabashed.

181,21874,8,"Laughter is the best medicine. This is a quote I have heard many times, and it seems to be easier said than done. A new school, new language, and no one who understands you can make anyone scared and uncomfortable, and laughter isn't always the antidote. Although, laughter with people you love and care for can also be a welcome relief from fear and worry. As my family's travels took us through @LOCATION1, laughter and happiness were the best ways to brighten a difficult day, give us courage, and make new friends. The most consoling laughter is that remembered. Moments that once seemed trivial now bring happy tears to my eyes. The moments associated with laughter are the ones I hold nearest to my heart. Memories that give me the most happiness are those of laughing with family and friends. When my little sister @CAPS1 and I stepped off the airplane in @LOCATION9, @LOCATION5, we were taken aback. Everything was bustling around us. There were taxi drivers calling out, hotel bellhops throwing pamphlets, and family members awaiting their arrivals. The taxi we hired was a respite from the world of @LOCATION1 outside. Many hours later, the four of us were safe in our hotel beds, but the two youngest of our family were nervous. My sister and I were jet-lagged and homesick, and were trying to cling to familiarity however we could. Board games served that purpose. Playing a familiar game in a new place brings up a lot of memories.Through the magic of @CAPS2 and laughing with our loving family, @CAPS1 and I were ready to tackle the challenges of living on a new continent. Living in @LOCATION5 was very different from living in @LOCATION7. Not only the language, but the culture was also notably contrasting to @LOCATION1's. The way people dressed, acted, and communicated were radically different in the southern hemisphere. With so much diversity around, it was extremely difficult to be comfortable going to school. After a day of trying to comprehend math lessons and @CAPS4 literature, home was very soothing. The bus ride home was a beacon of light, because it gave us hope for the comforting times during family dinner in our small @CAPS5 apartment. Every day I would calculate the weeks till the plane ride home, but I had a feeling that day would never @CAPS8. However, we knew each challenging day would be over soon enough, and jokes and anecdotes from home would give us the stamina to continue learning. Game time was relaxing for each family member, and we cherished those times, filled with laughter. Walking down the streets of a new city and country was unnerving. Cars swerved and honked, people rushed past, and buildings towered over us, with billboards supporting companies we had never heard of. Feeling safe in that environment was a stretch, and we were always on our toes. It took me about four months to become used to the daily routine. Morning: @CAPS6-up at @NUM1 am, catch the bus at @TIME1 and go to @CAPS4 school. Afternoon: @CAPS8 home on the bus, have a snack at the apartment, run errands, go to our language tutor and @CAPS8 home for homework, dinner, and bedtime. The next day it was repeated, and life was becoming average. However, it was then that our family uprooted again. We trekked around @LOCATION11 and the @LOCATION3, following something we called the @ORGANIZATION2, a mock @ORGANIZATION4. We began in @LOCATION12, then jetted to the desert and the city of @LOCATION4. Next we re-entered @ORGANIZATION2 domain, and visited @CAPS9, @LOCATION2 (a @LOCATION2 at @NUM2 feet), @LOCATION10, and @ORGANIZATION3. Seeing each landmark close-up was amazing. It was like each one had @CAPS8 out of a @ORGANIZATION1, and we were there to write an article about each. Also, we met other @CAPS10 speaking families on our travels. Interacting with other adventurers was comforting, and learning their stories was inspiring. Even travelers we had nothing in common with-like a man from @LOCATION6 who was traveling @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION8 with only his bicycle and a few bags-could relate to our feelings of isolation and struggle to learn the language. Through laughter and memories, we were able to make new friends, so far from both our homes. When you see a person's face light up after being told a funny story, it can make you smile too. Difficult times @CAPS8 upon everyone, and knowing that things will get better is a comforting thought. Far from home, and very susceptible to worries and fears, my sister and I relied on our parents and companions to console us and keep us open-minded.

182,21875,8," Laughter is a very important part of our lives. It is the greatest medicine for anything and everything. It is scientifically proven that if you are upset if you just smile even if you don't want to it will put you in a better mood. I do not like getting upset and try very hard not to, but when I am a competitive gymnast it is a part of everyday training. It is very rare that I have such a good day that I don't get upset once for five hours. I experienced how laughter helps keep me in a better mood.  Just the other day, @DATE2 the @NUM1 of @DATE1 I was having an off day. The warm up actually hadn't gone as bad as usual I started off okay, and the first event was not too bad. We started off on balance beam which usually just hearing the words ""go to beam"" puts me in a bad mood, but @DATE3 it wasn't half bad. We were supposed to do @NUM2 beam routines in @NUM3 minutes I did about @NUM4 which is the most I have ever done in one day. I felt pretty proud about that even though I fell on every single one of them, but I am starting to get used to it because beam isn't my best event. After beam we were on vault, I didn't do vault because I have a hurt wrist. So I just did some physical therapy for my wrist it was pretty easy. Then we got a break and I got to ice my injuries. After our @NUM5 minute break we started on bars. Bars is usually my favorite event but recently it has been pretty hard. I was having a really difficult time getting one routine done. I was starting to get upset when @PERSON1, my best friend, comes over and tells me some inside jokes to make me laugh. Being able to stand there and laugh with @PERSON1 made my day that much better.  @PERSON1 is one of my favorite people in the entire world. She always knows how to make me laugh even when I'm in a really bad mood. I don't know what I would do without her she is one of my best friends and an amazing teammate. After bars we were on our fourth and final event the floor exercise. I hadn't done floor in a long time because I recently sprained my wrist, but @DATE3 I figured I would give it a try. I was warming up one of my tumbling passes when I landed kind of weird. Pain shot up through my calf muscle it felt as if my muscle had torn in half. It was incredibly painful more painful than spraining my wrist. Since we are in competition season we can't stop when something hurts. Even though every single time I took a step my calf muscle hurt I had to try and make it through one full floor routine. I fell on my first pass then it was hurting too much so I didn't make my second pass. Then my coach was upset, and I start crying because my calf hurt so much. My coach didn't care of course, so I went in the bathroom so I could cry without getting yelled at.  I sat in the bathroom for about five seconds before @PERSON1 came in. She always knows exactly when I need her she told me everything was going to be okay. Then she told me some more jokes and I started laughing. It immediately made me feel ten times better. Her care to know when I needed her and the fact that she can make me laugh even when I'm in pain and upset gave me hope to go back out in the gym. My coach told me to do three more of my second pass. I did one and it hurt really bad I started crying again, but eventually I got all three done. My coach told me if it was really bad I could ice. I went in the kitchen and got some ice and wrapped it on my calf. It helped some but it still hurt to walk, so I was still somewhat crying. @PERSON1 seeing that I was still upset came over to me again and started singing out favorite song. Once again I started laughing and it made me feel ten times better.  I absolutely love @PERSON1 and envy her ability to make anybody laugh. Without her I don't think I would be able to go into the gym every single day. Those three times that she came up to me and made me laugh yesterday made it all worth it. I know no matter how bad I feel @DATE3 I will have @PERSON1 there to help me stay happy. Without laughter I don't think I would still do gymnastics.

After bars we were on our fourth and final event the floor exercise. I hadn't done floor in a long time because I recently sprained my wrist, but @DATE3 I figured I would give it a try. I was warming up one of my tumbling passes when I landed kind of weird. Pain shot up through my calf muscle it felt as if my muscle had torn in half. It was incredibly painful more painful than spraining my wrist. Since we are in competition season we can't stop when something hurts. Even though every single time I took a step my calf muscle hurt I had to try and make it through one full floor routine. I fell on my first pass then it was hurting too much so I didn't make my second pass. Then my coach was upset, and I start crying because my calf hurt so much. My coach didn't care of course, so I went in the bathroom so I could cry without getting yelled at. I sat in the bathroom for about five seconds before @PERSON1 came in. She always knows exactly when I need her she told me everything was going to be okay. Then she told me some more jokes and I started laughing. It immediately made me feel ten times better. Her care to know when I needed her and the fact that she can make me laugh even when I'm in pain and upset gave me hope to go back out in the gym. My coach told me to do three more of my second pass. I did one and it hurt really bad I started crying again, but eventually I got all three done. My coach told me if it was really bad I could ice. I went in the kitchen and got some ice and wrapped it on my calf. It helped some but it still hurt to walk, so I was still somewhat crying. @PERSON1 seeing that I was still upset came over to me again and started singing out favorite song. Once again I started laughing and it made me feel ten times better. I absolutely love @PERSON1 and envy her ability to make anybody laugh. Without her I don't think I would be able to go into the gym every single day. Those three times that she came up to me and made me laugh yesterday made it all worth it. I know no matter how bad I feel @DATE3 I will have @PERSON1 there to help me stay happy. Without laughter I don't think I would still do gymnastics.

183,21876,8," Laughter, @CAPS1 is it? Say someone makes a joke that is supposed to be a funny joke, but no one laughs after the joke has been told. If it is considered a ""funny joke"" then why did nobody laugh? To me laughter is something that I do when I find something funny or worth laughing at.  There are many different kinds of laughter. There's a chuckle kind of laugh where something is kind of funny but not funny enough to laugh hysterically at such as something funny on television. Then there is a laugh out loud kind of laugh where your making sound when you laugh but its not to the point where your laughing so hard that you have to gasp for air. Lastly there is a hysterical laugh. The hysterical laugh is where you laugh so hard where your abs start hurting because your laughing so hard. The hysterical laugh is the laugh where you gasp for air because you are laughing so hard that you have no time to breathe. Whatever it was it must have been really funny if you have forgotten to breathe.   Although there are many kinds of laughter there are many kinds of jokes such as, knock knock jokes, blond jokes, racist jokes, redneck jokes, yo mama jokes and many more. @CAPS1 type of world would this be without comedy? Without laughter your day to day activities would be no fun. Laughing gives you this feeling that you can't get without laughter. I think when you laugh it sends a chemical to your brain to let your brain know something funny happened so it can store that memory. You know how you forget stuff sometimes? Do you think if the events would've been funny you would've been able to remember them? Without laughter do you think everyone would be depressed? The times I laugh are the times I never forget because those are the best memories and the ones I want to remember the most.  I have this friend who I swear could be a comedian. He is the funniest guy I know. He can make me laugh without even trying, he just has that humorous personality that everyone loves because he's good at being the center of attention. Being funny just comes natural to him. The reason we have friends is so they can be there for you, but if they can't make you laugh wouldn't you consider them boring? When I make new friends usually the people that interest me most are the ones that aren't boring and who can make me laugh who I consider to be funny. Laughter is two different things, it is an action, and it is also a feeling. You can make yourself laugh at any time you want. Although when you laugh just to laugh you don't feel the same as you would when your laughing at something that really is funny. Laughter isn't necessarily a ""feeling"" but when you laugh it gives you a feeling of happiness. I can't think of a time when I have laughed for absolutely no reason unless someone told a joke that I didn't find funny but I figured I should laugh anyways and pretend it was funny to make them feel better about themselves.  In a relationship laughter is important. Can you imagine being in a relationship whether its with the opposite sex or if its just a friend kind of relationship and not laughing with one another? @CAPS1 would be the point? Yeah, you'll have someone there for you but when your crying or just down in general they wouldn't have a way to help you or cheer you up without trying to make you laugh. In a relationship where there is no laughter, would just be a boring relationship. Laughter is a hard thing to explain, without it everything would seem so boring. Since your used to laughing on a daily basis you don't notice how much you laugh because laughing is just a natural reaction. You don't control when you do or don't laugh. You can try not to laugh, but it doesn't always work. Have you ever noticed when something is really funny and you try not to laugh that after a couple seconds of trying not to laugh it just kind of blurts out all on its own.  Laughter usually comes from something funny. @CAPS1 exactly is the word ""funny?"" @CAPS1 does it even mean? I don't know the exact definition but I can almost guarantee if I looked it up in the dictionary that laughter would be under the word funny. We all know that laughter is a fun thing to do, because we all like laughing. I think that you could ask as many people as you want and they would all say they like laughing because its something we all do naturally. We don't know @CAPS1 its like to not laugh.

We were hanging out at the salon where my mom and @PERSON1 worked, and decided to go out for dinner because we have not seen or talked to each other in a while. We got done at the salon where my mom works at and then we all headed over to @ORGANIZATION1. My mom took me and @LOCATION1 in her silver car, while @PERSON1 took @PERSON3 with her in @CAPS1 red car.  We arrived at @ORGANIZATION1's so fast that we were waiting for @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 to arrive at the restaurant. When they arrived we all went in together and our waitress seated us at the big round booth. We started looking at our menus and then ordered some of there delicious food. I ordered a cheeseburger without bacon, my mom ordered quiche, my sister @LOCATION1 ordered strawberry pancakes and bacon, @PERSON1 ordered quiche as well, and @PERSON3 ordered strawberry pancakes and bacon also.  We started talking together more once we all got our food and started eating. We started joking about how the quiche looked like it was served with a frog on top, because the sauce the top part of my moms quiche looked like a frog. Then we were all eating and the waitress walked by @PERSON3 who was sitting at the end of the booth and she farted. He freaked out and put his hood over his head, and since he was wearing his sweatshirt backwards it went over his face.  We all started to finish off our meals and @PERSON3 started talking about magic tricks. Basically there would be a fork and a spoon or a couple knifes under a napkin and he would say ""touch it"" and then @PERSON3 would change the silverware around. @PERSON3 then yelled ""touch it"" throughout the whole restaurant and everybody in the restaurant could hear him.

185,21878,8,"   Laughter is what erases pain, it soothes the sadness a person might feel in their heart, and it can also cause a person to forget why they were mad. I believe that if a person loves to laugh than they can over come any pain especially when you have some one beside you who you know will always be there no matter what kind of past you have.   I knew of only one person that could always make me laugh no matter what. Our arguments never lasted because whenever i would get angry at him he would laugh because apparently it was cute. So he wouldn't take me seriously but I didn't mind because it made @CAPS3 bad moment turn into a moment of cheerfulness. Even though I am not with him anymore he still finds a way to make me laugh.  For example, the other day I had to sing at church again but I thought it was going to be like any other day where they announce my name and I go up there and blow everyone away with my amazing voice. But when I was going over the song I totally forgot the beat and how the song went. It felt as if my stomach flipped inside out so I started to panic. It was to late to turn back because they had already called me up, so there was nothing to do but to go up there and hope the words would come back to me. When the song started I was doing great but there came that line I kept messing up on so I tried ignoring it and just move on to the chorus but that didn't help because by then I didn't know where I was. I felt my knee's start to shake and I felt my face slowly start to burn from the heat of the moment. My first reaction was to stop singing before I embarrass my self even more. So I asked @PERSON1, the guy who was controlling the sound system if he could start it over, and he did. So this time I said to my self I can do it. As the song started up again I began hoping that this time I would remember how it went. The part I couldn't sing came up again and I tried to do the same thing of just going on, but I couldn't. I was so angry at my self that I apologized to the people who were watching me and I shamefully walked off the and went into the hallway. At that moment my mind started to spin with insulting thoughts about how dumb I was for not being able to cooperate and just keep going. I looked down at the ground when I felt a liquid substance slowly run down my over heated cheek. I felt so vulnerable because I lost and let the pain of embarrassment overcome me. I wasn't ready to go back in there but my @CAPS1 named @CAPS2 came out and hugged me. He said to me ""@CAPS3 singer has a moment where they fail and they just have to learn from that and be better the next time"".  He also kept going on and told me that it was better to mess up in front of people I've known for years than in front of some one I've never seen in my life. Once he was done talking to me he went inside and I went into the bathroom. Since no one was there i went into a stall and started to weep. I was thinking about how pathetic I looked so I took a deep breathe cleaned my self up and told my self that I looked ugly when I cry so I should really stop. Those were some very encouraging words because I left the bathroom and decided to go back inside but when I looked up I saw @PERSON2, my ex boyfriend. When he saw my red swollen eyes he hugged me and told me I did great. But I knew he was lying because I did the exact opposite of that. He asked if I wanted to talk about it but I shook my head no. Even then he ignored my request and grabbed my hand as he dragged me along to sit on the bench.   His excuse for me not sounding good was that the disc was scratched so it wasn't my fault but that wasn't possible because even the song sounded better than i did. I kept arguing with him like a stubborn child but who was I kidding. I wasn't going to win this one so I stopped. Through out this process of sadness it slowly turned into a smile I couldn't erase from my face. Its as if his words and smile lured me into laughing and forgetting about what happened.

186,21880,8,"                                 Laughter Laughter is a very important part of any relationship. Weather it is with a boyfriend, girlfriend, friend, or family member. Laughter brings people together, and in my opinion it's a major key to happiness and being successful in life. without laughter, life would be boring and bland.  My best friend's parents had just recently split up, and it was a really hard time for her. Her mom had lost her job, and not having a father to be there to support her and her mom while going through such a hard time was difficult. She wasn't used to the fact that her parents were not going to be living under the same roof or sleeping in the same bed anymore. She had to get used to going back and forth from her mom's to her dad's. Since my parents have been split up for as long as I can remember, I knew exactly what she was going through. I tried to make her realize that things happen that we do not have any control over, even if we do not want something to happen there is nothing we can do about it to make it how we want it. Everything happens for a reason weather we like it or not. I started hanging out with her more because she seemed like she needed a friend. We laughed and joked. One night we were so tired that we were laughing at every little thing that was happening. We were laughing so hard that her dad was getting mad because we were keeping him up. We decided that we should tape our mouths closed to keep us quiet, but we just ended up making more noise than we were without the tape. Our laughs were muffled because of the tape, but still loud. We ripped the tape off and started to bust out laughing.  I then realized how much of an impact laughter can have on a person, and how much it can change a situation. My best friend who had been sad and depressed, was now laughing and happy. It was like she was a completely different person. She realized that having her parents be split up was not so bad after all.  I told her all the good things about having parents that are split up. Sometimes when your parents split up, you become closer to them, like for me, my dad and I became best friends. Now she will be able to spend more quality time with her parents. Just her and them, without anyone getting in the way.  Laughing and always looking on the brighter side of any given situation makes life so much easier. I asked her the same question my older brother asked me when our parents got a divorce. Would you rather have them be together and constantly fight, or be apart and be happier?

My best friend's parents had just recently split up, and it was a really hard time for her. Her mom had lost her job, and not having a father to be there to support her and her mom while going through such a hard time was difficult. She wasn't used to the fact that her parents were not going to be living under the same roof or sleeping in the same bed anymore. She had to get used to going back and forth from her mom's to her dad's. Since my parents have been split up for as long as I can remember, I knew exactly what she was going through.

One night we were so tired that we were laughing at every little thing that was happening. We were laughing so hard that her dad was getting mad because we were keeping him up.

Sometimes when your parents split up, you become closer to them, like for me, my dad and I became best friends. Now she will be able to spend more quality time with her parents. Just her and them, without anyone getting in the way. Laughing and always looking on the brighter side of any given situation makes life so much easier.

187,21881,8," Laughter is one of the many concepts that we take advantage of in life. When I first think about laughing or laughter it all seems so simple, but the more I think about what laughter truly is the more I realize how significant to everyday life it is. Laughing is described as an expression of delight or amusement, but when the action of laughing and what triggers these things is further examined it just becomes blurred as to what laughing really is. Because at that point the more laughter examined the less meaning the word still maintains.There is a point in every persons life when they come to terms with some sort of idea or concept and its like a light being turned on. Although I am not very old I have some fairly extraordinary stories already.  When I was eleven years old I made many realizations about my life although I wouldn't have chosen the circumstances I don't necessarily regret what happened because they made me who I am today. At the time my younger brothers were two years old and a few months old. We all belong to the same family, but the experiences that we have encountered have affected us very differently. My youngest brother was born with health complications that nearly claimed his life more times than I want to think about. But as a family we were able to persevere.We believed that he was going to get better and with that state of mind and determination we made it through those times. Along the way we learned a lot not only about ourselves but about each other, we learned where each others strengths and weaknesses were.We also learned about what the important things really were in life. We understood that we should cherish each moment that we had because we never knew what was going to happen next. At times we became overly excited about him being able to hold down more food than he had the day before or laughing until we were on the brink of tears because one of his nurses had just told us a joke that made us forget about what was happening for just a moment.  At that point in my life I began to appreciate the smallest things that most people would never remember. Like when my younger brother was first born he had to be on a ventilator and had wires and tubes coming out all over him so when he was finally able to pass a car-seat test that would ensure he could be in a car and keep his respiration's at a normal level for long enough to get home.What might seem insignificant to others meant to us we were one step closer to being able to take him home. Those times have a very significant part not only in how we lived our lives at that point in time but also how we are living now. My little brother went through so much in his life at such an early age and if I could have traded places with him I would in a heart beat, even if that means that I would most likely not be alive today. I am grateful for the fact that he will have no recollection of all the surgeries and pain that he endured at that time of his life but at the same time I know that because of all he did go through that he is one strong little boy.  Now that my little brother is five and in kindergarten a lot of things have changed from when he was born, but what we have gotten out of the whole experience will be with us for the rest of our lives. There are moments that I reflect back onto all of those times and think about how much has truly changed for us since then. Like when my brother begins to laugh so hard he can hardly catch his breath I think back to the very first time that he laughed. That day we got a phone call from his nurse and at first assumed that something was terribly wrong when she said we needed to get to the hospital as soon as we could. When we got to the hospital and up to his room he was pulling on one of the animals on his baby mobile that was hanging down and it would bounce and he would start giggling uncontrollably. Whenever I think that my day couldn't possibly get any worse I sit and think about the times that were the hardest, when it would have been easier to turn away from each other we came together.The times when I was afraid of what would happen to my brother next but was too afraid to ask. Those moments are the ones that help me appreciate what is going good instead of focusing on the negative.I would never wish for my family to relive what happened at that time, but I hope that it continues to influence how grateful we are.",24881,38,25,883,4419,4.043035108,35.32, laughter is one of the many concepts that we take advantage of in life  when i first think about laughing or laughter it all seems so simple  but the more i think about what laughter truly is the more i realize how significant to everyday life it is  laughing is described as an expression of delight or amusement  but when the action of laughing and what triggers these things is further examined it just becomes blurred as to what laughing really is  because at that point the more laughter examined the less meaning the word still maintains there is a point in every persons life when they come to terms with some sort of idea or concept and its like a light being turned on  although i am not very old i have some fairly extraordinary stories already   when i was eleven years old i made many realizations about my life although i wouldn t have chosen the circumstances i don t necessarily regret what happened because they made me who i am today  at the time my younger brothers were two years old and a few months old  we all belong to the same family  but the experiences that we have encountered have affected us very differently  my youngest brother was born with health complications that nearly claimed his life more times than i want to think about  but as a family we were able to persevere we believed that he was going to get better and with that state of mind and determination we made it through those times  along the way we learned a lot not only about ourselves but about each other  we learned where each others strengths and weaknesses were we also learned about what the important things really were in life  we understood that we should cherish each moment that we had because we never knew what was going to happen next  at times we became overly excited about him being able to hold down more food than he had the day before or laughing until we were on the brink of tears because one of his nurses had just told us a joke that made us forget about what was happening for just a moment   at that point in my life i began to appreciate the smallest things that most people would never remember  like when my younger brother was first born he had to be on a ventilator and had wires and tubes coming out all over him so when he was finally able to pass a car seat test that would ensure he could be in a car and keep his respiration s at a normal level for long enough to get home what might seem insignificant to others meant to us we were one step closer to being able to take him home  those times have a very significant part not only in how we lived our lives at that point in time but also how we are living now  my little brother went through so much in his life at such an early age and if i could have traded places with him i would in a heart beat  even if that means that i would most likely not be alive today  i am grateful for the fact that he will have no recollection of all the surgeries and pain that he endured at that time of his life but at the same time i know that because of all he did go through that he is one strong little boy   now that my little brother is five and in kindergarten a lot of things have changed from when he was born  but what we have gotten out of the whole experience will be with us for the rest of our lives  there are moments that i reflect back onto all of those times and think about how much has truly changed for us since then  like when my brother begins to laugh so hard he can hardly catch his breath i think back to the very first time that he laughed  that day we got a phone call from his nurse and at first assumed that something was terribly wrong when she said we needed to get to the hospital as soon as we could  when we got to the hospital and up to his room he was pulling on one of the animals on his baby mobile that was hanging down and it would bounce and he would start giggling uncontrollably  whenever i think that my day couldn t possibly get any worse i sit and think about the times that were the hardest  when it would have been easier to turn away from each other we came together the times when i was afraid of what would happen to my brother next but was too afraid to ask  those moments are the ones that help me appreciate what is going good instead of focusing on the negative i would never wish for my family to relive what happened at that time  but i hope that it continues to influence how grateful we are ,1097,110,122,127,53,32,65,143,4,"Laughter is one of the many concepts that we take advantage of in life.

188,21883,8," In @NUM1 grade my life changed in a good way once I met @CAPS1. One day when me and @CAPS1 met, we clicked and are now are best friends. Our relationship is full with laughter, we hangout all the time. We enjoy going to the mall and listening to music. One day, I stayed the night over at her house on the weekends we listened to music while she was doing my hair, after that we had dinner and stayed up really late laughing and telling jokes. We've been friends for @NUM2 years. When me and @CAPS1 went to @CAPS2 in @NUM3 and @NUM4 grade I met @PERSON1 she was in @NUM5 grade when i met her and became best friends forever all through high school. @CAPS1, @LOCATION1, and i are all friends and once in a while we all hangout together we like to and listen to music. I have known @CAPS1, and @PERSON1 for long time and I have such good friends.

I would go fishing with @CAPS15 dad and make fun of him that @CAPS7 looked like fish that @CAPS7 would catch. @CAPS7 would always do the smoochy face and tell @CAPS11 if @CAPS7 could eat @CAPS11 with kisses. @CAPS7 would always make fun of @CAPS11 as well. @CAPS15 @CAPS8 would grab @CAPS15 dolls and and pretend that @CAPS7 was @CAPS11 playing with them.

On the year that i was gonna turn six, @CAPS15 dad decided to @CAPS20 @PERSON1 and @CAPS11 to @LOCATION3 to finally meet @CAPS15 grandma. This was @CAPS15 first time being alone with @CAPS15 dad. @CAPS15 @CAPS1 brother was only four so it doesn'@CAPS19 count. I was hungry, because of our long ride, so we stopped at @ORGANIZATION2's to eat breakfast. We were stuffed since we ate so much pancakes. So we decided to use a payphone and call @CAPS15 mom all the way to @LOCATION2. since we were in @LOCATION1. @CAPS15 dad made the snort face and started to laugh so we laughed with him and send a air kiss to @CAPS15 mom through the phone. She was crying wishing we were with her.Then we all said our goodbyes and we told @CAPS15 mom we loved her.   we came inside Of the car and we buckled up then we drove off. After a while it was getting hot and i asked @CAPS15 dad if @CAPS7 could @CAPS20 the extra blankets out. @CAPS7 said,   ""@CAPS4 mi amor, estas bien caliente con todos estos sarapes?"" (""@CAPS5 @CAPS15 love, is it to hot with this blankets?"")I said,""@CAPS4 papa tengo mucho calor!"" (yeah dad I am really hot.!) @CAPS7 laughed and gave @CAPS11 a kiss on the cheek, then @CAPS7 grabbed the two blankets. I just stared at him with a smile, then @CAPS7 finally smiled back and close the door. i was watching him @CAPS23 the back seat. @CAPS15 @CAPS1 brother was sleeping.  @CAPS15 dad looking at @CAPS11 smiling putting the blankets in the back of the car trunk. @CAPS3 i look back and then face @CAPS15 dad out of the no were a drunken lady hits @CAPS15 dad and @CAPS7 slams to the cars back window to the ladies front car side and back to the trucks window.

I didn'@CAPS19 want to believe it and i thought it was all a dream. But no it wasn'@CAPS19 @CAPS7 was paralyzed @CAPS7 looked pale and blood was coming out of his mouth like venom. All the life joy @CAPS7 had was running out like blood. I could feel in @CAPS15 vibrations that @CAPS15 father, @CAPS15 spider-man, @CAPS15 hero that kept telling @CAPS11 to do good in school was gone for ever. The smile of @CAPS15 face was gone now and for ever. @CAPS15 brother woke up crying and i was paralyzed and out of the no were i tell him that everything is okay @CAPS3 i know that our future is hell for now on. @CAPS7 falls back to sleep with his stuffed animal ratonsito.  Years past and i had a lot of difficulties at school. The @CAPS2 @CAPS23 class would make fun of @CAPS11 because i would wear @CAPS15 dads old shirts. They also made fun of @CAPS11 because i wouldn'@CAPS19 talk. I didn'@CAPS19 care i was proud. But all that changed @CAPS3 i got to @CAPS15 first fight with the bully @CAPS23 our school. I didn'@CAPS19 know what to do so i stepped away. She made fun of @CAPS11 and didn'@CAPS19 stop. I really didn'@CAPS19 want any problems. But i had to admit @CAPS15 life was a living hell. @CAPS15 mom would come @CAPS23 home and school( @ORGANIZATION1). I had nobody to talk to, but myself.

Maybe it's the subject, the teacher, the other kids in the calss,or maybe its just simply the time of day @CAPS12 have to take it. No matter the reason, @CAPS2 student has at least one. This story is about mine, and how it changed my life. I have always hated social @CAPS1/history. I was scheduled to take it fifth period in seventh grade. I couldn't find anyone in that class. Plus my eighth grade friends were telling me @CAPS7 a jerk the teacher, @LOCATION2, was. None the less I knew I had to take it all year. So, before ever setting foot in the class I decided I would just make the best of the whole situation. @CAPS7 I didn't know was that one kid in the class would change everything for me. Like everyone else, I showed up on the first day of seventh grade already sick of middle school. I felt like it just wouldn't end. The only class I had really been dreading was social @CAPS1. The first couple days are always boring but, in social @CAPS1 it felt ten times worse. I remember the first day I sat in a random seat and basically just hung out. I watched all the other kids, some doing the same thing as me other paying real close attention. On the second day of class I noticed that @PERSON1 was in the class. We had been friends the year before but had lost contact over the @DATE1. @CAPS4 looked out of place in the class. So, I decided I would start sitting by @CAPS13 and try to be friends again.  As the year went on we became closer and closer, we had tons of fun. It was the kind of fun we as students love but, the teacher don't. We were always laughing,and @CAPS8 quietly. We were always so loud about everything. A couple weeks into our second semester @PERSON2 told us we were going to be working on a project that would count for @PERCENT1 of our final grade. After @CAPS4 was done explaining @CAPS7 was required for the project @CAPS4 told us we could do the project with a one other person. @PERSON1 and I looked straight at each other which, of course, made us laugh. @PERSON2 glared at us. ""@CAPS3, please choose your partner wisely."" @CAPS4 looked at us, ""@CAPS5 that means @CAPS12 as @CAPS11."" ""@CAPS6 @NUM1."" We replied together as if practiced. Despite @CAPS7 @CAPS4 had said we still decided to do the project together. We thought it would be a lot of fun. We had two and a half weeks until we had to present. I can't remember @CAPS7 topic we chose but I do remember that we went to the computer lab for five days to get information. Those five days I think we worked hard. Still finding time to talk about other things. ""@CAPS7 are @CAPS12 up to this weekend @PERSON1?"" I asked on a @DATE2, the last day we were in the lab. ""@CAPS8 really sure yet."" @CAPS4 replied. ""@CAPS10 than likely just hanging around doing nothing."" ""@CAPS11, I'm heading to @LOCATION1 for a basketball tournement. Want me to bring @CAPS12 back something?"" ""@CAPS12 would do that for me?"" @CAPS13 voice became so soft. So I turned away from my computer to look at @CAPS13. @CAPS4 was already looking at me. A smile on @CAPS13 face and @CAPS13 eyes, they seemed so caring. ""Of course I would @CAPS14!"" I finally replied as soft and caring as @CAPS4 had asked. We looked at each other for a second longer then just busted up laughing. We couldn't stop till @PERSON2 came over and put @CAPS13 hands on our shoulders. We stopped so suddenly, it was like @CAPS4 had shot us or something. Then @CAPS4 walked away. Then we finished class working and laughing about the stuff we read. The bell rang and we left. One @CAPS10 period till the weekend. The weekend flew by. My team got another first place. I found lots of time to look for something for @PERSON1. The down part of the weekend was knowing I had to go to school @DATE3 but, it did mean I could give @PERSON1 @CAPS13 gift of shells and a postcard. When I got to fifth period on @DATE3 I gave @CAPS13 the gift. I could tell by the look on @CAPS13 face that @CAPS4 liked them. I felt on top of the world for making @CAPS13, of all people, smile like that. @CAPS3 a days whenever I am felling down or like a loser I think of @CAPS13, or go talk to @CAPS13. That is how I get from a bad day to a great day, by being friends with @PERSON1. If it wasn't fot that class I wouldn't have that.

I will always be thankful for that class.","Social @CAPS1 @CAPS2 student, at some point in their education, has a class they really hate. Maybe it's the subject, the teacher, the other kids in the calss,or maybe its just simply the time of day @CAPS12 have to take it. No matter the reason, @CAPS2 student has at least one. This story is about mine, and how it changed my life. I have always hated social @CAPS1/history. I was scheduled to take it fifth period in seventh grade. I couldn't find anyone in that class. Plus my eighth grade friends were telling me @CAPS7 a jerk the teacher, @LOCATION2, was. None the less I knew I had to take it all year. So, before ever setting foot in the class I decided I would just make the best of the whole situation. @CAPS7 I didn't know was that one kid in the class would change everything for me. Like everyone else, I showed up on the first day of seventh grade already sick of middle school. I felt like it just wouldn't end. The only class I had really been dreading was social @CAPS1. The first couple days are always boring but, in social @CAPS1 it felt ten times worse. I remember the first day I sat in a random seat and basically just hung out. I watched all the other kids, some doing the same thing as me other paying real close attention. On the second day of class I noticed that @PERSON1 was in the class. We had been friends the year before but had lost contact over the @DATE1. @CAPS4 looked out of place in the class. So, I decided I would start sitting by @CAPS13 and try to be friends again. As the year went on we became closer and closer, we had tons of fun. It was the kind of fun we as students love but, the teacher don't. We were always laughing,and @CAPS8 quietly. We were always so loud about everything. A couple weeks into our second semester @PERSON2 told us we were going to be working on a project that would count for @PERCENT1 of our final grade. After @CAPS4 was done explaining @CAPS7 was required for the project @CAPS4 told us we could do the project with a one other person. @PERSON1 and I looked straight at each other which, of course, made us laugh. @PERSON2 glared at us.

192,21888,8," Someone once said, ""Laughter is the best medicine,"" I agree. Laughter comes in different forms, from the simplest giggle, to a full on, originating from the bottom of your stomach laugh. When someone makes @CAPS3 laugh it brightens up even the worst of days. All through my years of school I have had a group of friends that have stuck with me through everything. Whether it be break ups or bad days, they have always known exactly how to get my smile back. My story begins with a fall of tears yet ends with a bus ride of laughter.  My sophomore year of high school I ran track. I decided i would attempt hurtles. Don't get me wrong, I'm an athletic person, however being only @NUM1 foot it was a challenge. Everyday @CAPS4 practice hurtles were the only thing I would practice. The majority of my friends did track along with me, they were doubtful that I could compete in hurtles @CAPS4 the next meet, however I was determined to overcome all there doubt and succeed. I would push myself harder and harder everyday till I was able to clear them with no problem. @CAPS4 the next meet my name was on the list for hurtles.  Warming up with the hurtles was no problem, I cleared everyone of them with ease. I was so confident that I could win this race with no problem. I had the speed and the accuracy of my hurtles well rehearsed and well plotted out. When I heard them call for my race my stomach knotted. Suddenly my confidence was gone, all I could think about now was falling flat on my face. My worst fear besides falling flat on my face, was hearing that dreaded ""@CAPS1 ouch"" from the crowd. I tried everything I could think of to get my mind off my race, ""its only a hundred meters,"" I kept telling myself, ""run, run, run, jump."" @CAPS2 soon @CAPS2 I heard that starter gun go off I ran my fastest and jumped @CAPS2 high @CAPS2 i could, I had completed all but the last one, I was in second place and all I needed was so lengthen my stride just a little more and I would have this race. The only problem with lengthening my stride was I hadn't planned out how many strides to do until I jumped. Before I knew it I was jumping way after I was supposed to. The next thing I knew I was on the track with blood coming out of my elbows and knees, and tears in my eyes. My only intuition was to get up and run. @CAPS2 I finished the race I ended up in third place, not to bad for my first hurtle race but not @CAPS2 good @CAPS2 the first I would have been in. When i had time to cool down after my race my coach came up to me, I was prepared to hear the worst. With tears still in my eyes I put my pride behind me and went and faced him. ""@CAPS3 did great kid,"" he said @CAPS2 he patted my shoulder. I would have never expected him to say that. When I made my way over to where all my friends were standing and watching, they were all awaiting me with huge smiles on their faces. ""That was the best race I've ever seen!"" announced on of them. ""@CAPS4 least @CAPS3 didn't fall completely on your face, @CAPS3 could be missing teeth right about now!"" said another. My friends and I had a great laugh about how many different ways my race could have gone worse. It made my horribly embarrassing moment so much better. Instead of having one of those awkward silence bus rides home with my team we all had a great time talking about each others races that have gone wrong.  Even though I had one bad race I still do hurtles, I have found that the more I laugh and have a good time with my races the better I do. If I were to just be hard on myself and not have a good time during track season then I probably wouldn't want to participate in that sport anymore. Without laughter and fun there is no motivation to do something even if your good @CAPS4 it. Eventually @CAPS3 will get burnt out. When ever I think of a time when laughter was one element or part I always think of this. It is true, Laughter is the best medicine.

194,21890,8," Laughter is one of those details in life that you can use, but after a while yes, you will gettried but its fun. Ether you laugh of something funny, or someone with someone ,or at someone ,or just simply at some memories that you have had before that were funny . It is just something you probably do every single day or else you are a very boring person and you don't have any humor in your system. Laughter is very importantbecause  that way you can have happiness in your life as well as your family and your surroundings. I mean just imagine your life with out laughter i think that it would be a pretty boring life.    Now a true story that happened to me. @CAPS6 aside form that the story went like this: I was @NUM1 @CAPS2 old and it was @CAPS1 @CAPS2 my @CAPS4 wanted to go spend @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with his family, but my mom don't get along with my dads family very well, so he decided to take me. I didn't have a very good relationship with my cousins either. So i told my @CAPS4. ""@CAPS4 can i please stay over here with my moms side of the family not to be rude, but i don't like my cousins over there"" and he said ""that the reason im taking you just because you are not that familiarized with them you haven't treated them so you cant say that you don't like them"". So i was practicably forced to go. I was at the party that they where having and then one of my cousins said ""why are you so grumpy"" and then i said @CAPS10 just ...... i was about to tell her because i don't like you or my other cousins, but i stopped my self then i didn't say anything. she started talking to me. "" @CAPS5 do you want me to tell you a joke ? ""@CAPS6"" yeeeeaah @CAPS6 so there was a class room in were ever and the teacher said @CAPS6 class has started so every one sit down. then she say's stand up if you think you are stupid and @CAPS9 one stand-ed up except for this kid and then she said why do you think you are stupid? @CAPS9 @CAPS9 im not stupid i just didn't want to see you being the only one standing up hahahahahahahah hahahahahah funny laugh you guy's better laugh. @CAPS6 ill laugh so i started to laugh then i realized that she wasn't that bad she was actually really cool and down to earth person and then she introduced me to different people that i didn't even now that they were my cousins, that night was assume after all. See laughter can bring people together @CAPS9 mater how different they are from another, but that joke was pretty funny wasn't it? Any who hears another story im going to tell you. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 my friends and i are going to school. When we got there everyone was tired too."" just like us and well the teacher didn't look that tired because teachers are always smiling and well just very up beat people except for the mean teachers"". So then we all sat down , and listened to the teacher talk ,and talk about who now's what. Then a girl witch is my friend too went to the sharpener, was sharpening her picle when she let it go and the pincle dropped to the grownd. She decided to pick it up from the grown-ed likewise while she bent bown we all herd this riping sound. I guess someones pants are on to tight thus her getting up real fast and just funning to the bathroom evyone was laughing so hard that i think some people were about to pee. It was very funny for us but for her i must of been very emberising i felt really bad for her that moment. even the teacher was laughing i remember it like it was yesterday. ""@CAPS10 wait it was yesterday""."" jk it was when we were all in @NUM2 great!"" @CAPS11 all of this. After all the laghs that we've had.

Our campfire is huge more like a bondfire but it has to be inorder to for everyone to keep warm. Tents are scatterd across the area leaving room for all the trails.

196,21893,8,"  Fall began early, @CAPS6 was in full swing and the crispy, red stained leaves of @DATE2 fluttered to the pavement at the beginning of @DATE1. In my tired blue jeans I strode up the steps of the @ORGANIZATION1, crunching fallen leaves under my tattered @ORGANIZATION2 sneakers. With slight hesitation, I volunteered to chat with patients who don't have many family near by and for some, the most contact they receive all year is a quick call on @CAPS1. Never having met me before, they would still be thrilled to see me. Leading me, the stout receptionist, showed me down a carpet hall. Porcelain vases of fake tulips placed on antique tables lined the wallpapered walls, attempting to create a feeling similar to home. We stopped at a cheery yellow door on the right side of the hall, room #@NUM1.   Before we could knock, the door flung open with more might than I would have expected from the frail women who stood behind @CAPS6. Easily nearing her mid nineties, the @CAPS2-@CAPS3 women had tired eyes and leathery skin, her face showed her aged and wisdom before she spoke.   ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 there darling, I'm @PERSON2, and whom might you be?"" her eyes wide, she spoke with a thick southern accent.

That quick nervous question I stuttered, rippled into a much longer and deep conversation. @PERSON2 shared stories about everything, previous patients, terrible nurses, as @CAPS4 as the terrible pranks she has played on nurses. In between my gasps for breath, I could barely spit out another question, that only triggered another hilarious tale that @PERSON2 told so perfectly. @PERSON2's voice carried a story like none I had heard before, for such a small women her life seemed adventurous and eventful. Her stories were endless, and so was our laughter. Besides the ache in my side from my nonstop state of hysterics, I couldn't of been better. Our differences were like sugar in hot tea, dissolving before we noticed they were there. Stereotypes of race and culture that I placed between us, were whisked away and we were sewn together by our laughter.

Cherishing our time together, the conclusion of our afternoon grew near. If you hadn't of known, you would probably think @PERSON2 and I had been friends for years. The way we got along easily, and our conversation that flowed freely, made our relationship appear nurtured over time but laughter brought us that same feeling in only hours. Through her age and experience she connected with me through laughter and story telling. Learning so much about her life, past, family and even at her age of @NUM2, her hope for the future, I felt as though I had known @PERSON2 far longer than just a few hours.

Our pleasant visit ended as I walked @PERSON2 back to her room.

That night we started talking about the old times when we weren't such trouble makers but just care free kids with no care in the world about boys just me and her against the world. That's what the plan always was even if we got married or moved away from each other we would always be close. We laughed and laughed about the old times when we would fake yell and scream at each other just to get attention just because we loved it. We talked about how our lives were great until boys came along and how we were so perfect just the way we were. Laughter has always brought @PERSON1 and I so close even in the worst of fights like when our boyfriends got us into a fight. It was the worst fight we could have ever possibly gotten into. We both said things that weren't true and turned friends against each other which was horrible. But when we found out our boyfriends cheated on us we talked it out for a while and resolved things. All we do now is just laugh there is nothing in the world that can bring us down we are free spirited young ladles and we love each other just the way we are no questions asked. If someone made me pick them or @PERSON1 I would pick her in a flash and she would do the same for me.

People all around the world are laughing, somebody is laughing every second of everyday. Many people believe that laughter is a very important part of any relationship. To me, laughing is a type of happiness and it's always good to have that kind of happiness. There are many ways to make people laugh, for example: jokes or stories. There are also many people who can make you laugh, anyone can fit the description. Such as a mom, a dad, siblings, extended family like aunts, uncles, cousins, teachers, and of course any type of friends. All the people listed have made me laugh at some point in life. Babies, pets, and people on television also make me laugh. It's always good in life to have that certain someone who will always be there to make you laugh. If someone told me to pick one person in my life who has always made me laugh it would be very hard to choose because so many people make me laugh so I wouldn't be able to choose just one person; however, my parents would be high up on the list. Brent @PERSON2, my dad always has the best jokes and stories to tell. He always tells them at the perfect time. His jokes range from redneck jokes, blond jokes to yo momma jokes and more. He also always has a good story to tell me about when he was my age. All the trouble he caused in the small town where he lived located in @LOCATION1, those stories always get me laughing. Hes got good jokes about and sayings about farts too. Those ones are my favorite because they are the funniest. I always laugh until it hurts. @PERSON2, my mom also always has something funny to say just like my dad, my mom has very many jokes. I'm glad I have parents that make me laugh and I look up to them for that, along with many other things.  Like I stated earlier, many people can make me laugh. My best friend @PERSON1 would definitely be high up on the list too. @PERSON1 and I have been best friends for almost six years now. It all started in the seventh grade. Middle school was great and now here we are juniors in high school. We will be best friends forever. We are inseparable. Its kind of like we're connected at the hip, we do everything together. @PERSON1 and I have uncountable memories most in which we have pretty much died on the floor laughing. We make each other laugh all the time, it could be about anything too. Together we can make any situation funny wherever we are. We think so much alike, if people knew they would probably think it's weird. Because we think a lot a like we think a lot of the same stuff is funny, even when other people don't think it is. We just laugh. Not only is it important to laugh at whats funny but you also need to laugh sometimes when its not so funny.

So I hurry out the door and run to my house which was about seven blocks away. I get to my house and then I go inside and my mom says why are you late and said I lost track of time. She asked why I lost track of time and I say that we were playing video games. Then my mom said next time look at the clock more often than that so I said ok I will. So the next day I go over to my friends house and see that he is looking for something so I say dude what are looking for? He said I lost my emblem and I said what is that? He said it was his grandfathers army emblem that his grandfather gave to him and that it was very important to him. So I said where did you leave it the last time you saw the emblem? He said on my dresser. So I said did look behind the dresser, on the floor, under your bed. He said yes and looked away. Then he paused and turned to look at me. Said did you take it so I said no way. Then he said to me in a aggressive voice are you sure about that. Then I said yeah why would I take it isn't mine to take.

203,21902,8,"Just @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @DATE1 is @LOCATION2's @CAPS2. This year she turned fifteen. It is a tradition to go to the @CAPS2 girl's house. Before we went to her apartment building, we thought we should stop by @ORGANIZATION1 and get her a gift.  I was with @PERSON2, @PERSON5 and @PERSON3 when I got the brilliant idea of getting her a chew toy. It is also tradition to get her the randomest present you can think of. So we went to the doggie section and got her a duck that quacked. We put the duck in a cup that had a friendship quote written on it. We all thought it was really funny and almost peed ourselves in the isle. Luckily, none of the workers were there to yell at us. When we got to her house we gave her the duck. We all burst out laughing, yet again, when she couldn't figure out how to make it quack. @CAPS8 a dog was smarter than her. @PERSON1 was already at her house when we arrived. We were united and ready to be loud, annoying, and very crazy.  After a while, we got tired of sitting around doing nothing. Then, @CAPS1 brilliant idea hit me. @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 was only about a ten minute walk from her building. On our way there, we stopped at the gas station for some monsters. @PERSON2 found cat food and suggested we buy it for @PERSON4. Again, we laughed and I was afraid that we would get kicked out, as we have before. @PERSON3 and I decided it was best to wait outside before we got even louder. After a few minutes they came out with arms full of monsters.We all know that monsters make us entirely too hyper and we are three times as loud. So I decided not to drink mine and give it to @LOCATION3; someone had to stay sane and keep everybody else out of trouble.  We were finally at @LOCATION1. Immediately, we started playing on the swings and the little jungle gym. It was a miracle that we all fit since it was made for kids under ten years old. @PERSON1 and I stayed behind to take pictures of this crazy day. When @PERSON5 fell down while trying to climb up the slide, we couldn't hold it in. But thank god no one was around to hear our roaring sounds of laughter. The girls and I got really bored after exploring the @LOCATION1. We decided to head to @CAPS3 and buy @PERSON4 a cake. The lady asked if we wanted anything written on it. Since it was at no extra cost, we decided to put ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"". For some reason the lady had a really hard time spelling her name and we thought it was hilarious. But then again, after a few rounds of monsters, we think everything is hilarious. We kept asking her random question, such as, ""@CAPS7 you have to go to a special school to learn how to write names in frosting all professional?"" @CAPS8, you did have to take special classes. We thought it was amazing and laughed. I think the lady was getting a little scared. We have that effect on some people who aren't used to us. Once we got to her house, @PERSON3 started getting a really bad stomach ache. She rolled around on the floor, moaning as if she were in labor. @PERSON2 thought this was the funniest thing she had ever witnessed. We have an echo effect on each other. When one of us laughs, someone else joins. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh caused me to start laughing. I made a donkey noise which trigged @PERSON1. Hearing @PERSON1's goofy laugh made @PERSON4 chime in. Then we heard a squeaky mouse noise and knew it was @PERSON3. @PERSON5 was last to join, no one can hold in their laughter after listening to @LOCATION4.  We all laughed for about ten minutes straight. When things were finally calming down, I snorted really loud and we all started cracking up again. @PERSON4's parents weren't home to listen to our loudness so we didn't get in trouble.

I was with @PERSON2, @PERSON5 and @PERSON3 when I got the brilliant idea of getting her a chew toy. It is also tradition to get her the randomest present you can think of. So we went to the doggie section and got her a duck that quacked. We put the duck in a cup that had a friendship quote written on it. We all thought it was really funny and almost peed ourselves in the isle. Luckily, none of the workers were there to yell at us. When we got to her house we gave her the duck. We all burst out laughing, yet again, when she couldn't figure out how to make it quack. @CAPS8 a dog was smarter than her. @PERSON1 was already at her house when we arrived. We were united and ready to be loud, annoying, and very crazy. After a while, we got tired of sitting around doing nothing. Then, @CAPS1 brilliant idea hit me. @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 was only about a ten minute walk from her building. On our way there, we stopped at the gas station for some monsters. @PERSON2 found cat food and suggested we buy it for @PERSON4. Again, we laughed and I was afraid that we would get kicked out, as we have before. @PERSON3 and I decided it was best to wait outside before we got even louder. After a few minutes they came out with arms full of monsters.We all know that monsters make us entirely too hyper and we are three times as loud. So I decided not to drink mine and give it to @LOCATION3; someone had to stay sane and keep everybody else out of trouble. We were finally at @LOCATION1. Immediately, we started playing on the swings and the little jungle gym. It was a miracle that we all fit since it was made for kids under ten years old. @PERSON1 and I stayed behind to take pictures of this crazy day. When @PERSON5 fell down while trying to climb up the slide, we couldn't hold it in. But thank god no one was around to hear our roaring sounds of laughter. The girls and I got really bored after exploring the @LOCATION1. We decided to head to @CAPS3 and buy @PERSON4 a cake. The lady asked if we wanted anything written on it. Since it was at no extra cost, we decided to put ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"". For some reason the lady had a really hard time spelling her name and we thought it was hilarious. But then again, after a few rounds of monsters, we think everything is hilarious. We kept asking her random question, such as, ""@CAPS7 you have to go to a special school to learn how to write names in frosting all professional?"" @CAPS8, you did have to take special classes. We thought it was amazing and laughed. I think the lady was getting a little scared. We have that effect on some people who aren't used to us. Once we got to her house, @PERSON3 started getting a really bad stomach ache. She rolled around on the floor, moaning as if she were in labor. @PERSON2 thought this was the funniest thing she had ever witnessed. We have an echo effect on each other.

204,21903,8,"Dad's @CAPS1 In the not so distant past I needed to buy my father a birthday gift. The usual cologne and tie were too frequently his gift, so I decided to go into the uncharted waters of @CAPS2 and get him an amazing gift. I walked into the store, with red and white isles, with @PERSON2 my older sister and @PERSON1 my younger brother. We all had the same goal, but different results, to get our father a gift @CAPS3 would love. The search then began. After much time considering @CAPS5 to get my father @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 bought him new socks and I bought him a @CAPS1 that held batteries and could even vibrate, for a closer shave. Little did I know that @CAPS1 would change the lives of my brother and I, and this is where the adventure truly begins. Several days after I had given my father the @CAPS1 as his birthday present, I saw it next to the sink glinting in the light. @PERSON1 and I were brushing our teeth as usual after our lunch. I know your recommended to brush after meals by the dentist, but no one ever really does. I wanted to be a pediatric dentist when I grew up so I made sure my brother and I brushed our teeth. @PERSON1 was spitting blobs of white foam into the sink and I made it a course of action to make mine bigger than his. This was a competition I had seen on a movie many years before and it made my eight year old brother brush more thoroughly. I was almost ready to rinse when the @CAPS1 caught my eye. My brother had begun to rinse his green toothbrush. I played with the button that turned the vibrate on and off. I demonstrated the function to @PERSON1. My gift was definitely better than his, but @PERSON1 seemed to disagree.  Then out of a pure joking tone I whispered, ""I dare you to shave your eyebrow off.""  @CAPS3 smiled and showed his infamous dimples, the same dimples @CAPS3 had shown when @CAPS3 first learned to tie his shoes and ride his bike without training wheels. I loved my brother and I didn't think @CAPS3 would ever attempt such an impulsive stunt. @CAPS3 grabbed the @CAPS1 and turned the vibrate button on, then just as it was above his eyebrow @CAPS3 quickly turned the vibration off and slid the @CAPS1 down his eyebrow. His eyebrow had disappeared in the blink of an eye, and my jaw dropped to the recently re-tiled floor. My brother stared at the mirror in shock, his deep brown eyes almost out of their sockets.  Was my brother a fool? @CAPS5 had @CAPS3 just done? The answers came just as soon as the questions had. My brother didn't know that the @CAPS1 would shave when its vibrate button was off. @CAPS3 had thought it only shaved when the vibrate was on. I began to smile uncontrollably and laughter started to roll out of my mouth and into the air. @PERSON1 had shaved half an eyebrow off! @CAPS3 stared at me with anger marked by the wrinkles on his forehead.  ""@CAPS4't tell mom,"" was all @CAPS3 could say. @PERSON1 knew that as soon as our mom knew @CAPS3 would be lectured for sure. @CAPS3 went the day without eye contact from others, for fear they would notice the missing eyebrow. To me this was hilarious and a story I would preserve in my memory for my future family. All the work my brother was doing to hide this secret wouldn't last for long. Someone would have to notice, and it was the last person @CAPS3 desired to have know. My mother came home and began to cook dinner. We set the table and I couldn't stop staring at @PERSON1's nonexistent eyebrow, I began to giggle and @CAPS3 started too also! Then it turned into a roaring laughter. My mothers attention immediately was directed toward us. I couldn't talk. As soon as I sucked in enough air she asked @CAPS5 was going on that she didn't know. I told her the truth, and @PERSON1 looked down at his palms. I ran out of the kitchen holding onto my stomach, and into the living room where I could hear my mother. ""@CAPS5 were you thinking! You know better than to take a dare..."" I could hear the words floating away from the kitchen and into my ears. The lecture went on for several minutes until my mom noticed the steaming red rice on the stove top. I came back in when I thought things had cleared. We sat and ate our dinner in silence, and didn't mention my brothers nonexistent eyebrow.  To this day this profound story makes my brother and I laugh. We can look back on it and appreciate the cleverness of how everything it seems was almost planned out. @PERSON1 has avoided razors near him in the bathroom and now brushes his teeth alone as to resist temptation that could cause humiliation.

Someone would have to notice, and it was the last person @CAPS3 desired to have know. My mother came home and began to cook dinner. We set the table and I couldn't stop staring at @PERSON1's nonexistent eyebrow, I began to giggle and @CAPS3 started too also! Then it turned into a roaring laughter. My mothers attention immediately was directed toward us. I couldn't talk. As soon as I sucked in enough air she asked @CAPS5 was going on that she didn't know. I told her the truth, and @PERSON1 looked down at his palms. I ran out of the kitchen holding onto my stomach, and into the living room where I could hear my mother. ""@CAPS5 were you thinking!

The lecture went on for several minutes until my mom noticed the steaming red rice on the stove top. I came back in when I thought things had cleared. We sat and ate our dinner in silence, and didn't mention my brothers nonexistent eyebrow. To this day this profound story makes my brother and I laugh.

Although chuckling with @PERSON1, the rest of the group and I do not find the moments of @PERSON1's childhood especially funny, therefore, because nothing is to be said- we merely laugh. In moments such as these, I recall a time when I had to use laughter as an action although I did not find anything especially funny.  During the prime of my youth, there was a time I had to use laughter when nothing could be said. I remember it now, I was only four years old, the time when my parents were undergoing a divorce. During this time, my father would lock me and mt siblings in our room in a fit of rage, and my sister would softly cry. Being only four years of age, I had to laugh- for nothing else could be said. I had to laugh to comfort my sister, I had to do so, so that my family might stay together.

Have you ever felt like the light that surrounded you is turning off leaving you in the dark, cold, foggy waters of a waste land? Have you ever lost all hope and just cried? Well why cry when you can laugh at life? Laughing can cure your heart from any negativity. Laughing is another natural way to release stress and brighten your mood. Laughing can bring two people closer to each other than words because when you laugh, @CAPS1 is an unconsciousness way of bonding. I remember when I once experienced the ability to bond with another person just by laughing.   I was in middle school and @CAPS1 was our last class of the day, @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I knew no one in that class so I sat there in my desk while the rest of my classmates came in. Then two girls came and sat next to my seat and started to talk to each other. I could tell they were friends and they seemed very nice. I asked them a question and while I asked the question I used some of that humor that all my friends said I had. The two girls started laughing and I smiled at them. We soon became friends but we weren't close friends just classmate friends. I wanted to get to know them better so I kept on joking around like I always did around my friends. Soon we started to become closer and closer to each other and for every @CAPS3 study project we had, us three were always partners. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 did get very boring and all we three wanted to do was laugh and talk.

We had an important @CAPS3 @CAPS4 speech coming up and we had to present our timed speech to the whole class. Those two weeks the three of us rarely talked, in fact all we quite did was smile at each other and keep on working on our speeches. I didn't like the distance building on us because I still wanted to be their friend and I didn't want to be alone again. I realized that my only chance of talking to them was on the day of the presentations. I came up with a plan and I was determined to proceed with my plan on the day of the presentations.

Then our @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher came in the class and told us that we had to be quiet and pay attention to all of our classmates speeches. When the first speech started both of my friends were paying attention, as well as I was, but for some reason my friend who was siting in front of me turned around and started to laugh. I automatically hushed her and she placed her head down on the table. I could see how her whole body was shaking and her head was bobbing up and down. This caused me to have an explosion of laughter and soon I was bobbing my head up and down too. We couldn't stop laughing because when ever she placed her head down to laugh I would look at her and start laughing, which would cause me to place my head down laughing and she would look at me. @CAPS1 was a laughter marathon and our stomach's ached and tears rolled down our red faces. We both wanted to stop laughing because we didn't want to get in trouble but there was no way of stopping because we would look at each other and see how we would shake when we laughed. we also felt like we were disrespecting our classmates but the teacher saw that we just couldn't stop laughing and didn't say anything.

208,21908,8," Once when I was on my way over to my best friend @PERSON1's house, she called me and said that I wont be the only one over there hanging out that day. She said her friend ,@CAPS1, had surprised her by showing up unexpectedly at her house. I wasn't going to leave and be rude, so I still proceeded on going over and enjoying some girl time. The drive was about an hour long and I had fallen asleep in the car while my mother was driving next to me. The car had come to a complete stop and the rumbling under the hood had awaken me from my slumber. As my eyes began to opened I realized I've arrived at my destination. I noticed an unfamiliar car that was parked in the drive way, I assumed her friend was older and it was hers. It was a black @ORGANIZATION1 with tinted windows and seemed rather expensive. I opened the door, took a step and my mother was already with my belongings. We were trotting down @PERSON1's gray, swirled, paved walking path talking about when she would come get me tomorrow. I couldn't help but to notice that the grass was so green and freshly cut while the wind was making the trees dance. A grin took over my face as @PERSON1 bolted out of the front door and we tumbled in to the yard. I was so extremely happy to be back with her. My mother said hello to @LOCATION1@NUM1's mom, and left for the evening. @PERSON1 and I ran up her stairs while packing my stuff up like mules, we were out of breath by the time we got to the top. Everything was going just how i thought it would be, this was until we got into her room. @CAPS1 was laying on @PERSON1's bed as we entered, her face was the only thing that moved. This sassy smile crossed her face and her eye balls were lost in her head from rolling back to far. All of a sudden i felt awkward and didn't know how well I was going to fit in. They were watching a reality television show that I was not aware of and never heard of before. Jumping up asking to go make some food they looked at me and said, ""you know where the kitchen is."" I never felt that low in her house before, I don't know why it effected me the way it did, but I felt as if I were in my own home, alone with no one to talk to. So I ran down the mile long flight of stairs and made up some juice and brought it up stair to share with everyone. @CAPS1 snapped at me, for that wasn't the kind of juice she liked, @PERSON1 didn't even budge just laughed, I put on a fake smile; said ""sorry."" I put the jug down and didn't know how to act after that. Her mother came up in the room and informed us that dinner was ready and we should all go wash up. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 were excited to go eat but I felt like a troll, slump and sad. This was not how I was expecting things to be. While we were in the bathroom @CAPS1 was joking around with me and I was shocked, I didn't know how to respond. A low deep chuckle exited my mouth and everyone began to laugh with me and at me all at the same time. It was quite weird how the ice was broken in the bathroom ,but now I feel more comfortable around them. We made a bet who ever gets to the table first doesn't have to do the dishes. Bolting down stairs for the first seat at the table, @CAPS1 slipped on the floor and tears rolled down my face as if I were crying in pain. But it wasn't pain, it was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. She got up and @PERSON1 beat us all to the dinner table first. @CAPS1 and I got stuck doing the dishes for the night, while @PERSON1 just watched and laughed. We were laughing about how she fell; @CAPS1 and I really began to bond.  The night became more exciting with more things to laugh about and things to do.

She said her friend ,@CAPS1, had surprised her by showing up unexpectedly at her house. I wasn't going to leave and be rude, so I still proceeded on going over and enjoying some girl time. The drive was about an hour long and I had fallen asleep in the car while my mother was driving next to me. The car had come to a complete stop and the rumbling under the hood had awaken me from my slumber. As my eyes began to opened I realized I've arrived at my destination. I noticed an unfamiliar car that was parked in the drive way, I assumed her friend was older and it was hers. It was a black @ORGANIZATION1 with tinted windows and seemed rather expensive. I opened the door, took a step and my mother was already with my belongings. We were trotting down @PERSON1's gray, swirled, paved walking path talking about when she would come get me tomorrow. I couldn't help but to notice that the grass was so green and freshly cut while the wind was making the trees dance. A grin took over my face as @PERSON1 bolted out of the front door and we tumbled in to the yard. I was so extremely happy to be back with her. My mother said hello to @LOCATION1@NUM1's mom, and left for the evening. @PERSON1 and I ran up her stairs while packing my stuff up like mules, we were out of breath by the time we got to the top. Everything was going just how i thought it would be, this was until we got into her room. @CAPS1 was laying on @PERSON1's bed as we entered, her face was the only thing that moved. This sassy smile crossed her face and her eye balls were lost in her head from rolling back to far. All of a sudden i felt awkward and didn't know how well I was going to fit in. They were watching a reality television show that I was not aware of and never heard of before. Jumping up asking to go make some food they looked at me and said, ""you know where the kitchen is."" I never felt that low in her house before, I don't know why it effected me the way it did, but I felt as if I were in my own home, alone with no one to talk to. So I ran down the mile long flight of stairs and made up some juice and brought it up stair to share with everyone. @CAPS1 snapped at me, for that wasn't the kind of juice she liked, @PERSON1 didn't even budge just laughed, I put on a fake smile; said ""sorry."" I put the jug down and didn't know how to act after that. Her mother came up in the room and informed us that dinner was ready and we should all go wash up. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 were excited to go eat but I felt like a troll, slump and sad. This was not how I was expecting things to be. While we were in the bathroom @CAPS1 was joking around with me and I was shocked, I didn't know how to respond. A low deep chuckle exited my mouth and everyone began to laugh with me and at me all at the same time. It was quite weird how the ice was broken in the bathroom ,but now I feel more comfortable around them. We made a bet who ever gets to the table first doesn't have to do the dishes. Bolting down stairs for the first seat at the table, @CAPS1 slipped on the floor and tears rolled down my face as if I were crying in pain. But it wasn't pain, it was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. She got up and @PERSON1 beat us all to the dinner table first. @CAPS1 and I got stuck doing the dishes for the night, while @PERSON1 just watched and laughed.

209,21910,8," My mom and I have a unique relationship. She is my caregiver, but also my best friend; we do everything together. One of our favorite things to do is have dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. If you've ever been to @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON2, you'd know that the actual color of the walls is unknown, since every inch of drywall is covered with paintings and photographs. As we were being seated, one particular photograph caught my eye. Directly ahead, to the right of the arcade and underneath an abstract painting of something I couldn't quite identify, hung the greatest snapshot I had ever seen; blacks and whites so vivid the image seemed to have a dreamy-blue tint. It was an up-close photograph of a trickle of water being poured over the head of a chubby baby . There was a slight upturn of the left side of his mouth (accentuating his already pudgy cheeks) as he squinted his eyes to deter the invading trickles. He was simply bewildered by this new sensation. The minute I spotted this masterpiece I lost all sense of self-consciousness and restaurant etiquette. I laughed. I laughed like I had just regained the ability and was desperate to make up for lost time, like suddenly everything that was wrong in the world had frozen and this baby and I were the only two people left. I fell back in the cramped booth, billowing and hollering until my mom couldn't help but join in. In that pure moment, all that mattered was the two of us and that mystery baby, sharing in an innocent bliss called laughter. Have you ever been in one of those awkward silences, when everyone thinks the guy next to him will be the one to start the conversation? It's uncomfortable, at least until somebody chuckles at the irony of the moment, and a chain begins. The next guy laughs at the first guy's untimely giggle, until everyone is rolling around with tears streaming down their face. Those moments are beautiful. Think of a painter with a blank canvas. He'll stare and stare, hopelessly searching for inspiration, but it isn't until he takes a risk and breaks the white silence that all the innovation rushes in. In no time, he has a masterpiece, all thanks to that random splotch of pure desperation that he nervously started out with; that random laugh that caused a chain of joy. Laughter brings people together because its something everyone has in common. When you laugh, and I mean truly laugh, you couldn't be more open to the people around you. Laughing is involuntary; it's the most vulnerable thing you can do. @PERSON1's @CAPS1 defines the term laughter in a very particular way. But laughter can have different meanings for different people. For example, to a scientist, laughter is the contraction of the diaphragm in erratic motions. To a comedian, laughter is a sign of success. To some, laughter refers to embarrassment or failure. But true laughter comes from joy, whether the @CAPS1 says it or not, and its necessary to any healthy life. Although @PERSON1 refers to laughter as ""a sound of or as if of laughing"", it's not entirely true. A laugh is hard to fake; in fact, its nearly impossible. When your boss tells a bad joke and you give him a pity giggle, he can tell. Now when your boss trips over the cord to the projector and you nearly bust a button, he can also tell, because there's nothing like true laughter. We can say that laughter is an important part of life. We can write essays, do surveys, and study patterns until we're blue in the face, but in the end, it all comes down to the real thing. If someone told me to describe laughter to someone who had never laughed before, I would be at a loss. It's an expression that has to be seen, heard, and felt to be comprehended. Even everyday, we text these three letters: @CAPS2, laugh out loud. Why? Because they mean a little bit more then a smiley face or back-to-back ha's. It means that whatever they said to you made you laugh out loud, whether you snorted, honked, or shot your drink out of your nose. If laughter could bring me the simple joy I felt that evening in @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON2, break an awkward silence, or bring two people together in a way that words couldn't, then clearly, laughter is more than just a sound or a function.

I was so thankful that i had remembered to put on deodorant. I couldn't even tell you how far we walked, but i will say this, "" @PERSON2 and i started down the street form @ORGANIZATION1 and walked past @PERSON1, up this little back road @CAPS9 we saw nothing but burnt crusty yellow grass and a bunch of cows. We walked all the way to this little trail that was about a ten minute walk to the edge of the @CAPS2. I'm not going to blow smoke up your alley, it was not a straight stretch walk, we took many brakes and stopped at every little place we could find to pee. Not long after we reached our destination, we jumped in the deepest part of the @CAPS2 we could find. The water was ridiculously freezing so we immediately cooled down. we kicked back on the hot rocks and let the sun dry our bodies off. We lit up a cigarette, one of the few we had left from the walk, popped open a @CAPS10.Pepper, and regained our energy@NUM1 and I were finally going to get up and try to find crawdads, even though we were enjoying the sun way too much. We walked along the bank of the @CAPS2 and would lift up rocks to see if any were just chilling under one. @PERSON2 found four before I could even find one. I had never seen one of these miniature crazy lobsters before so I didn't exactly know what I was supposed to be looking for.We had both decided to take another brake, but this time we sat on our floaty in the @CAPS2. After about fifteen minutes of relaxing, I told @PERSON2 I had to pee again. She told me to just pee in the water and no one would ever know, but honestly that would of been so awkward to just stick @CAPS4 bottom half in the water and pee while @PERSON2 was watching. I told her I told her i could hold it until I found a better place. When five minutes passed, I was about to pee out of @CAPS4 eyes; I had to go so bad. I got off of @CAPS4 floaty and started to walk in the water towards the rocks. The sound of the water splashing every time I stepped did not help @CAPS4 situation at all@NUM1 the sneaky little devil she is, decided to grab one of the crawdads she had found and tried to sneak up form behind me with it. I was walking to the perfect place when all of a sudden I felt something cold and @CAPS3 on the back of @CAPS4 neck. I jumped back and turned around almost hitting @PERSON2, to find that she had the crawdad in her hand. She shoved in @CAPS4 face to @CAPS9 I almost cried then threw it on me like it was thing. I fell to the ground in panic and when I stood up, I had realized that I had @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pants. I was mad at first but i couldn't help but laugh. We laughed so hard that tears came out of our eyes. As soon as we tried to get our selves together, we realized that we had not packed an extra change of cloths. I am not the type to walk around knowing i @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pants, but I am the type for a good laugh and some happy tears with @CAPS4 best friend @PERSON2.

214,21916,8,"   Have you ever had a really bad day and nothing could make it better? When you just feel like giving up but then your best friend comes along and some how changes that all because they know just what to do. Well that happened to me. My best friend and her mom are amazing. They both are there for me and it is like they are my other family. When I need someone most I go to them because they always know just what to say and do when things get bad.    It had been a long week and everything was going down hill fast at home. My dad and I were constantly fighting and so were my boyfriend and I. It was on the @TIME1 of @DATE1, after a five hour dance practice as my friend, @PERSON3, and I headed back to her house for the @TIME1. As we were walking my dad called me and asked me what happened at school that day. I of course, had no idea what he was talking about and he started yelling, the beginning of yet another fight. He said the school called for I had missed a class that day. I completely forgot and explained calmly what had happened and why I did not go to class. He began to yell more. He started to tell me that I was not aloud to see my boyfriend anymore also I was not aloud to spend the @TIME1 at @PERSON3's house anymore, I began to yell now. After about ten minutes he hung up and I broke down. @PERSON3 talked to me and calmed me down. We got to her house and went on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. As I sat there and watched her on the computer I text my boyfriend telling him my dad said he was no longer able to come over. I called him and he yelled at me then said, ""@CAPS3 is not going to work out. We fight too much and I can not take it any longer."" I broke down and hung up on him.   Walking into @PERSON3's room her mom walked in and held me as I wept in her arms. She was a little intoxicated and was telling me that boys are dumb and they do not think before they speak. She helped me calm down and as I did @PERSON3 walked in and began to tell me what she had told my now ex-boyfriend. I smiled a little. They both started telling me that I could find someone better and I would be fine. Even though I was completely crushed. As @PERSON3's dad walked by her mom yelled for him to come into the room so I could hit him because I was mad at boys and it would help me calm down. I began to laugh. Sitting on the floor, I grabbed a towel that was laying on the ground next to me and began to wipe my @CAPS1, as I did, @PERSON3 told me that was her towel and yelled down the hall at her mom that I wiped my boogers on her towel, @CAPS3 made me laugh a little more. We laid down and watched @CAPS4.V. then went to sleep.   Waking up the next morning I did not feel any better but still got the momentum to get ready. As we got ready for doing nothing that day we talked and laughed about every thing. My day was not going that bad. As the day went on we grew restless and really needed something to pass the time. Just then our friend, @PERSON1 called and asked if we wanted to go dancing with her and @PERSON2. We said yes and got ready and went out with them. We were having a good time laughing every time a boy asked us to dance, and every time we said no. We stayed for about two hours and as we left @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 got these two random guys numbers. We then went to @ORGANIZATION1's house and spent the @TIME1. All four of us were laughing and watching movies, then three o'clock rolled around and we were all exhausted. We climbed into bed and slept peacefully throughout the @TIME1. As we awoke the next morning we were all still pretty tired but put on music and again got ready for an uneventful day. Getting ready we were screaming songs and laughing for we all sounded terrible but it did not matter since we were having a whimsical time. That is my story when laughing helped me, seeing laughing is a good cure for a broken heart. When people laugh they always feel happy doing it. You hear laughter where ever you go and it is such a magical sound. No other sound can compare to a laugh. Laughing is not only a medicine for a broken heart but also a good work out for your abs.

The day when on as we all ate and talked around the table at our camp I stared singing a @CAPS4 song to my self and @PERSON8 recognized it.

217,21919,8," Laughter is a good part of life. It demonstrates character. My sister, @CAPS1, can make me laugh, even when I'm mad at her. She is silly, yet serious when she needs to be. She likes to think of others before herself, and that gets her into more trouble than it has helped her. @CAPS1 and I go way back to when she was two years old and I was four or five years old. She is not my biological sister. My family has ""adopted"" her into the family, after her and I had become best friends. We have always been there for each other. We have never left each other out in the dark. One year when I was twelve and she was ten, I was staying at her house, and I had learned this song in choir at the elementary school that I was attending,and I taught her the song. It goes: ""@CAPS2, @CAPS2 baby, @CAPS2 by the roller coaster, sweep, sweep baby, I don't wanna @CAPS3 you go, shimmy shimmy coca puff, shimmy shimmy rah, shimmy shimmy coca puff, shimmy shimmy break @CAPS2, two bad kids sitting on a fence trying to make a dollar out of @MONEY1, @CAPS9 they missed, they missed, they missed like this"" and @CAPS17 it just repeats itself getting faster and faster. @CAPS1 had this idea to change it. She said ""@CAPS3's say, your hot instead of the break @CAPS2 part."" @CAPS4 now we were walking @CAPS2 the street singing the ""new"" version of the song that @CAPS1 had made, and @CAPS9 some guy was walking on the side walk going the opposite direction. @CAPS1 pointed at him while we sang the ""your hot"" part and he stopped and said "" @CAPS6, I think I am a little too old for you two."" We started to laugh @CAPS4 hard that our sides hurt. After we calmed @CAPS2 from laughing @CAPS4 hard, we told him that we didn't mean to point at him, and that we were just singing. I think @CAPS1 did because when we got back to her house she told me that she though he was cute, @CAPS4 maybe she did mean to point at him or maybe she didn't, I never asked her.  The day after that, we had gotten into a fight at her house, @CAPS4 I left and walked around the block for quite some time. @PERSON1 her mother, came and looked for me. I was sitting at this beautiful white church @CAPS2 the street from her house. @PERSON1 came looking for me and when she found me she sat next to me and asked why I was @CAPS2 here all by myself.

219,21922,8,"There have been many times in my life that I have had a good long worthwhile laugh. Things like scaring people, embarrassing myself in public, and doing stupid stuff for bets. But some of my favorite memories involving a good laugh were with people that I love. It was in the middle of the @DATE1, my youth group and I were going on a missions trip to a place in eastern @LOCATION1 called @LOCATION2. @LOCATION2 is a small town with a population of three-hundred, and is about four-blocks by four-blocks. Our whole purpose of going there was to set up a @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, for the fifty kids that live there. In our opinion, it was a major success. But the @CAPS1 isn't where all the laughs come in, it is pretty much anytime between them.  This was another one of those times where some of the best memories happen in a swimming pool. Other than the church we were staying in, we spent the most time swimming. In the pool were some of the best, and worst, times that I had in @LOCATION2. For example, I love doing tricks and flips into pools, but there needs to be a long and bouncy diving board. That's exactly what @LOCATION2 had. With my youth group, we spent hours upon hours playing and do tricks with the diving board. When we got bored with that, which took at least an hour and a half, there were many people up for a pool game or two. Which one pool game with us lasts about a hour. So, like the diving board, we spent a ton of time with it. This leads me to my worst times I had, the pool games. I have been known for being a very competitive person, and the during the games my competitive spirit was definitely shown. That made it easy for me to get mad at myself, which was why it was one of the worst times. But now looking back on these great but horrible nights, I say I was being stupid. I had some of my best friends by my side and I was mad? I now look back it and laugh, just like every other memories I have of the little town of @LOCATION2.  As I said earlier, @LOCATION2 was very small town with only about two cops. So we decided that no matter where we went in the town, we were going to ride in the back of a truck. That meant about thirty kids in the back of a @ORGANIZATION2 in the small town of @LOCATION2. This was fun but embarrassing for most. But during these car adventures were where we had some of the best laughs. Things like the guys all pretending to be the wings to make the car go, or the girls doing doing the guys hair, or even having funny conversations talking about the events that happened that day. The driver would also have a fun time, by swerving back and forth on the road just enough to make us off balance but not to make us fall off, we then learned quickly to hold on to anything within reaching length. The laughing didn't stop there, it continued on little trips I made with friends.  In @LOCATION2 we took many little adventures of our own while we were there. But my favorite would have to be with my two best friends. We had to make a video of our whole trip there. We were like those annoying people that always have their cameras out and were taking videos, but that made the job all the more fun for us. Our little adventure started when our pastor said we were going to take videos of the never ending fields surrounding @LOCATION2. It was just us three guys so we made a good time of it, and it was one of the best times all three of us had there. We did things like standing through the sunroof of the truck, and climbing through an old broken down wheat mill. Unfortunately for us, the one day we decided to be crazy in the car, the one cop from @LOCATION2 was roaming around. But that made it more exhilarating for us. That trip was not only fun, it was a good time and it brought us closer together as friends.  The @LOCATION2 trip was one of the best trips any of us have ever been on. That not only makes for good memories, but it makes for a good laugh. Every time any of us see each other we look back on the memories of @LOCATION2 like swimming and playing pool games, riding in the bed of the truck, having our own little adventures, or even going snipe hunting trip. @LOCATION2 was a growing experience, not only for me but also the ones that I love.

We also go to enjoy the great amenities this area has to offer, both business and pleasure. We go crabbing, commercial fishing, hunting and boating, but also enjoy hiking on the various mountain trails, located directly in the backyard.

On one day back to the house, my dad stops on the remote road again, and stops, getting out of the drivers seat. I get in, trying my very best to not expose my nervousness, and strap in. The pickup lurches as though stung by a bee, my dad purposely mushing his head and stiffening his neck into the head rest. Sheepishly, I put the truck into motion, and ease out the clutch as slowly as possible. In doing so, the accomplishment and swiftness startles me, and the engine chokes and goes out.

I falsely try to familiarize myself with the brake, gas and clutch and intentionally kill the motor, propelling us forward. Then, I cleanly start the truck, and professionally drive off, going onto the highway, and onto the severe hill where on the top, my grandparents three story house is.   As I get out of the drivers seat, I can see my sister extremely distraught in the back seat. She is literally in tears, because as departed from the wheel, my father said with a sense of pride swelling in his voice, ""that's my boy, you really have a driving knack, just like your old man."" @CAPS5 said this as to further provoke the hilarity of the situation, but it just pushed my sister over the edge. She storms out of the cab, and marches up the stairs of our grandparents house. My dad and I sit, perplexed at her severe emotional level, and then I go up and tell her, saying that i have practiced for every day she has been gone, and it was all a joke.My sister looks at me, stunned, then a sly grin creeps on to her face.

221,21924,8,"  Laughter has played a significant role in my life, getting myself and my loved ones through hard times. Helping to keep the smiles on our faces even when every aspect around us @MONTH1 cause us to frown. In my eyes, with laughter every day seems a whole lot brighter.   When I was younger my family was very close, I lived with my mom,dad,and sister. My dad worked full time while my mom stayed home and took care of us, we had, what you can imagine, a pretty normal life style. Not rolling in wealth, but my dad made a pretty comfortable living. In my eyes everything seemed perfect. What i couldn't see was the cracks in the foundation of there relationship. Nor would i ever be able to understand, at my age of six, that some things are not meant to be. They role played such a realistic, fantastic, but fake happiness and mutual love for one another for so long. But they could no longer pretend. They were numb, emotionless. going day to day on auto pilot, a change was desperately needed. It all came to a screeching halt one @DATE1 after noon, I remember that day like it was yesterday. It was a normal morning. Then a fight broke out, I knew this had to be the point of one of them giving in.. They had never fought in front of us before. He stormed out and left us, just like every other morning. Except this time my heart was heavy, I could feel the salty tears about to fall.. I knew he wasn't coming back. Shortly he turned around and made his way back into the living room, where everyone was arranged along the couch. Next comes the talk, the dreaded talk that no one wants to hear. ""its not your fault, some things just don't work out...etc.""in the end though, all of those thoughts are already automatically lodged into your head. Then it was over, it felt so unreal. The family was officially torn between two, reality hurt. Although the truth is much sweeter than living a lie. I remember how hard my mom tried not to show her true emotions, @CAPS1 laughed and joked around with me and my sister to hide the depth of her heart ache. My dad moved into a small home, and my mom moved into a comfortable home of her own. Custody wasn't an issue because there was no way in hell my mom would even consider giving up custody of us. My dad knew that he was not going to win that battle, he settled at her request. We started remodeling our new home. It was a place where my mom would feel independent, accomplished. @CAPS1 would stay up all night working on the kitchen, making every single part of it perfect. @CAPS1 wanted it to be a place for us to grow and flourish, a place to call our own. Saying my mom was a perfect mom would without a doubt be an under statement, @CAPS1 took us on trips, kept the smiles on our faces, encouraged us to pursue anything we wished to do, comforted us, laughed with us, appreciated us, took care of us. Not only did @CAPS1 do all of that, @CAPS1 did it all on her own. That to me,still to this day, makes me smile. So many memories still flood my brain with colorful images of our past. We lived a very warm and fofilling chapter of all of our lives there. My mom met someone in the later years, who soon became a very important person in my life. My step dad. They were married happily, seeing someone treat her so amazing, was truly heart warming. Together they had my youngest sister and our life became very different. It was no longer the three of us. I couldn't grasp the idea of it at first but seeing my mom happy was a very good thing for me and what i came to realize is that it was the beginning of our new family. Our new life. Life sometimes will throw you off coarse, but a true test of character is what you do with the challenges thrown your way. Laughing and making the best out of every situation is truly something to feel accomplished of. My family has been through a lot together, in my opinion it has shaped us and made us stronger as a whole. laughter is a key element in my family's relationship, and even if we are past a lot of those hardships, it is always important to keep on smiling. Keeping the good energy flowing. With out laughter i couldn't visualize half of the good memories I have had. I can look bad at what we have gone through, and see the bad times. More importantly though, I can look back and remember what got us to how we are today. laughter is something that I will forever be grateful for.

Last @DATE1 while my friend @CAPS1 and I were hanging out we got a phone call from our other friend @PERSON1. She was all alone in her house and told us there was a ghost in her house and that she kept hearing footsteps. She asked if we would come over for a little bit, we thought she was going crazy but we went to her house anyways.   When we got there @PERSON1 looked terrified. She was getting mad that we didn't believe there was a ghost in her house so she told us to follow her and see if we could hear the same thing she was hearing. We all went in the back room, turned all the lights off, and laid completely still. At first we heard nothing, then all of a sudden it sounded like someone walking down the hall. Quickly we turned the lights back on and started back to whatever it was that we were doing.   Later that day, @PERSON1 decided to take a shower, so @CAPS1 and I just stayed in the front room and watched @CAPS3. All of a sudden we heard this big crash, it almost sounded as if @PERSON1 had fallen in the shower. We ran into the bathroom and asked if she was okay and she said she was perfectly fine but was a little frightened by that loud noise. She gets out of the shower and finds a picture frame that was hanging on the wall, on the floor and broken, we all wondered how that could happen when it hadn't been bumped or anything. Although we were hysterically laughing, all we could think of was the ghost!  As @CAPS1 and I are getting ready to leave @CAPS5 house and go home for the night we invited @PERSON1 to come stay with us so the ghost doesn't get her. When she asks her mom, her mom said no but that we can stay their if we want. @PERSON1 was begging and pleading with us to stay, so much it started becoming funny. Thinking it was funny we kept saying no, and that we didn't want to stay in a haunted house. We stayed for a little longer then we got up to leave and tell @PERSON1 goodbye while laughing so hard we can barley talk because of how scared she was.

224,21927,8,"  Everybody laughs in their life time, sometimes they are good laughs other times they are bad laughs but in the end you have a good time wherever you are. Here is my story about why laughter is important in any relationship.  When you are in a relationship and they make jokes, you laugh because they are funny to you there for you laugh at them. If you didn't then why even say jokes anymore there would be no point in even saying them or reading about them or anything. Lots of people learn about them, study them, and say them to try and make people laugh so they would all have a great time. I think everybody has laughed and made jokes and just did funny things to make other people laugh because some people like seeing others happy. When you laugh that makes you smile and basically in a way that means your happy.  I know when i see my friends laugh or people that i know laugh it kinda makes me laugh and it makes me happy and then we all just make jokes and we all laugh some more and just have a good time. I love seeing people happy and laugh because it totally makes my day so much better especially if its someone I'm in a relationship with.  I think everybody should laugh in there life time because everybody should be happy and enjoy there life so laugh and be happy and your life will be amazing! I'm pretty sure there is not one person in this life time that has not laughed once in there relationship.   Your partner should always try to make the other person happy because that's just what you do and how your relationship work's. If the other person doesn't make you happy or laugh then why be in it because i was in a relationship one time and i was not happy at all because he never made me laugh or feel alive like you should when your with someone. We were so much better as friends then we were when we were together. So before you start dating someone you should make sure you actually like him and he makes you laugh and makes you happy before you guys get together. If you don't then you will always ask yourself why you got with him and when you should break it off and if you really should or not. You should get to know him more then you do and see if you guys are way happy as friends and then try being together. That's what i didn't do, i didn't get to know him enough and we were really good friends so i thought we would work but i was wrong. I had to break up with him because it was killing me knowing that he didn't make me laugh and he never will so i had to say good bye and i did. It was hard but sometimes its just something people need to do. So now we try and to be friends again but its not really working like i thought. We haven't talked in like a week. So sometimes that's just things you have to sacrifice.

225,21928,8," Laughter to me is important in any relationship, whether its between friends and family or you beloved other. To me it's like the gateway to any conversation. Through laughter is how me and my boyfriend met. @PERSON1 is one of the funniest people I have ever met. I have always thought that a person that could make me laugh would be the right one for me. @PERSON1 right now, at this point in my life is the perfect match. When @PERSON1 and I just met it was more of a friendship. We got to know each other, we hung-out, and we both didn't want a relationship at this time in our life. The more we talked the more fun I had with him. I can't stand to be a serious person at all, to me it is so boring. When we talked there was nothing serious about our conversations. He would make me laugh about the simplest things. @PERSON1 liked to quote funny movies, talk about awkward situations, joke around, etc.. After the fist couple of weeks I realized that the only times I was always smiling or found myself having a lot of fun was when I was around @LOCATION1. It's what brought me to like him even more as a friend. Although he was always a fun person to be around and also the one to go to so I could have a laugh, he also used laughter to get me to open up when I was feeling down.  I've always had a rough life at home and at times it's really hard on me. When it get really hard I shut down and I won't talk to anyone. Even though @PERSON1 was the person to always make me feel better, I wouldn't talk to him either. I found it very hard to talk to him and tell him what was going through my mind. @PERSON1 understood that and he would try to make me laugh little by little. He wouldn't make me laugh at stupid things or anything or even my situation. He would make me laugh at simple things, the way he said something, or he would try and do something so he could grab my attention. While those times he would make me laugh, it also made me see that I could open up to him. He wasn't making fun of my situation or trying to just find out about my home life and what troubled me, he was trying to make me feel comfortable and get me to relax. It made me feel more relaxed and like he wasn't trying to judge me or say my problems would get better even though sometimes that isn't the real answer I'm looking for. I ended up opening up to him. I can now tell him absolutely everything and in the end he'll always make me laugh about it.  This story might not be the best story at telling how laughter is an element or anything but to me it's the best at telling how a person can open up and relationships are built. I in no way was looking for a relationship at all and yet now I find myself with a person that can even make me laugh at myself. Laughter cant cat also get people to open up.

226,21929,8," I believe that laughter is a huge part of any relationship. It doesn't just help make the relationship stronger, but it also brings you closer. It shows that your having fun and that's what its all about. I mean who wants to have a boring relationship with someone? I know I wouldn't because life is all about having fun and doing what you enjoy most. If laughter didn't exist than this world would be an extremely boring place to be.  My best friend and I are always doing something to make us laugh. I think that are relationship of being such close friends is because we both have a silly personality. We are like to peas in a pod. We absolutely love to have an amazing time doing things we enjoy and always laughing at the stupidest things that aren't even funny half the time. When I get really down or depressed about something I can always count on her to cheer me up and make me laugh. She will also make me extremely mad sometimes, but she fixes it by laughing at me and then it tends to make me laugh as well. She is my other half and I don't know what I would do without her. The funniest thing that has ever happened in our six years of being best friends is when we were playing @NUM1 grade kick ball in physical education. We are both blond and sometimes the blondness tends to get to our brains. As we were playing we were both on the same team of course. We were in the outfield because it was the other teams turn to kick. Someone on the other team kicked the ball super hard as it almost hit the top of the gym. As it was flying up high in the air we were both going for it.  We weren't paying attention to where we were running because we were so focused on being the one to catch the ball. All of a sudden we ran right into each other. We fell to the floor laughing hysterically almost to the point where we couldn't breath and tears were pouring down our cheeks. Of course everyone else who was out playing kick ball almost died laughing as well. That is one story that I will never forget. Laughter could be a good thing to have if you want to succeed in life. It helps you get through the day and it can help take your mind off things if you aren't having quite the day you thought you would be having. I know that my best friend @CAPS1 will always cheer me up by laughing with me or at me. She is the type that loves to have a good time and we both just click. Our personality's are almost the same, but she is a little more crazy. She is loud and always has a smile on her face. We practically always have something funny to tell each other. I am the type that is always laughing at everything. People usually make fun of me because I laugh so much, but its not a bad thing because I am someone who likes to make other people laugh and have a good time. Laughter is a big part in life and I believe it because you can't have fun without having a smile on your face or laughing. I know that when I grow older I will look back at my past and laugh about all the stupid things I did. It doesn't just make you stronger it makes you want to live your life to the fullest and enjoy every moment you can because you never know when that time can come to an end.  Memories are always something you can look back on and laugh at. I hope that I will be able to have many more memories and look back and laugh at all the stupid things I did and the choices I made.

It doesn't just help make the relationship stronger, but it also brings you closer. It shows that your having fun and that's what its all about. I mean who wants to have a boring relationship with someone? I know I wouldn't because life is all about having fun and doing what you enjoy most. If laughter didn't exist than this world would be an extremely boring place to be. My best friend and I are always doing something to make us laugh. I think that are relationship of being such close friends is because we both have a silly personality. We are like to peas in a pod. We absolutely love to have an amazing time doing things we enjoy and always laughing at the stupidest things that aren't even funny half the time. When I get really down or depressed about something I can always count on her to cheer me up and make me laugh. She will also make me extremely mad sometimes, but she fixes it by laughing at me and then it tends to make me laugh as well. She is my other half and I don't know what I would do without her. The funniest thing that has ever happened in our six years of being best friends is when we were playing @NUM1 grade kick ball in physical education. We are both blond and sometimes the blondness tends to get to our brains. As we were playing we were both on the same team of course. We were in the outfield because it was the other teams turn to kick. Someone on the other team kicked the ball super hard as it almost hit the top of the gym. As it was flying up high in the air we were both going for it. We weren't paying attention to where we were running because we were so focused on being the one to catch the ball. All of a sudden we ran right into each other. We fell to the floor laughing hysterically almost to the point where we couldn't breath and tears were pouring down our cheeks. Of course everyone else who was out playing kick ball almost died laughing as well. That is one story that I will never forget. Laughter could be a good thing to have if you want to succeed in life. It helps you get through the day and it can help take your mind off things if you aren't having quite the day you thought you would be having. I know that my best friend @CAPS1 will always cheer me up by laughing with me or at me. She is the type that loves to have a good time and we both just click. Our personality's are almost the same, but she is a little more crazy. She is loud and always has a smile on her face. We practically always have something funny to tell each other. I am the type that is always laughing at everything. People usually make fun of me because I laugh so much, but its not a bad thing because I am someone who likes to make other people laugh and have a good time. Laughter is a big part in life and I believe it because you can't have fun without having a smile on your face or laughing. I know that when I grow older I will look back at my past and laugh about all the stupid things I did. It doesn't just make you stronger it makes you want to live your life to the fullest and enjoy every moment you can because you never know when that time can come to an end. Memories are always something you can look back on and laugh at. I hope that I will be able to have many more memories and look back and laugh at all the stupid things I did and the choices I made.

I would tell them about anything that bothered me. I am an only child so @CAPS1 mom is like the sister i never had. We used to go on picnics together. We would walk and talk and @CAPS8 would warn me of the dangers of the world. I liked those walks best. @CAPS8 would tell me stories of her childhood and make me laugh, we loved to laugh. As time went by I began to grow apart from @CAPS1 mother, I looked for friends to take her place. I think that hurt her the most. we would grow close from time to time, but lets face facts I was growing up. One day me and @CAPS1 mother were on our way out to the car after just finishing lunch. @CAPS8 and I had been discussing something and the conversation was taking a turn for the worst. It had turned from a mere discussion to an argument. You could feel the tension in the air, our tempers were skating on thin ice. I wasn't sure how this was going to end. We walked out to the car in silence. I remember thinking to myself (well wonderful @CAPS2, what have you gotten yourself into this time?) I opened @CAPS1 car door and stepped inside, I looked up and saw that @CAPS1 mother was watching me in the mirror. I began to feel these dark, cold, angry emotions twords her, emotions that made me feel sinister. I had never felt this way about her before. It was all so new to me. I thought back to those times when I had been sad, or upset and @CAPS8 would make me laugh. or the days when I had had one of those bad days at school where nothing went right and I would come home to her waiting smile and loving arms. @CAPS8 would make me a cup of hot coco and we would laugh and joke about those girls at school that made you feel like your life wasnt that important. I wanted one of those moment so bad right then I would have given anything for one. Just then it was as if @CAPS8 had heard @CAPS1 thoughts. I looked up and found her trying to suppress a smile. I too began to feel that small tickle deep within you that made you have the urge to laugh. A panic rose in @CAPS1 mind. (@CAPS3 @CAPS2, don't give in, you must stay mad or you will have lost the argument.) I tried and tried not to laugh, but it was @CAPS3 use. A giggle started in @CAPS1 throat. Then @CAPS1 mother began to giggle as well. not long after @CAPS1 father too began to laugh. pretty soon we were all rolling around on the floor of the car laughing histarickly. what we must have looked like the three of us laughing so hard. after a while we calmed down. Our stomachs aced from laughing so hard. ""@CAPS5 were you laughing?"" @CAPS1 mother asked. ""I don't know, I was laughing cause you were laughing. @CAPS5 were you laughing?"" I asked. ""I was laughing because your father had made a funny face."" @CAPS1 mother replied. ""@CAPS7 @CAPS5 were you laughing?"" @CAPS8 asked @CAPS1 father. ""I was laughing because I felt left out of the big joke and I couldn't believe I missed it."" Said @CAPS1 father. We all busted up laughing again at our ridiculous reasons for laughter. After awhile i couldn't even remember @CAPS5 i had been mad in the first place. I looked at @CAPS1 mother and the angry emotions were gone, i had @CAPS3 hard feelings twords her, only love. I believe @CAPS8 felt the same. To this day I cant remember the argument or how it had started. All I know is that laughter is the best medicine.

229,21934,8,"                            Laughter @CAPS1 I was a little girl I didn't know all that much. The only things that I was concerned about were what dresses to put on barbie or what names to give my stuffed animals. I did not know anything about relationships or what things were important to keeping one. As I got older, and more wiser, I realized that the two main things you need, in order to even start a relationship, were a sense of trust and a good sense of humor. After you learn to trust someone, then it's all downhill from there.  Laughter is what keeps things interesting. Without it, people wouldn't be so happy. My family has always had a good sense of humor, and the way some of them laugh, especially my dad, just makes things even more worth laughing over. My dad has always been the funny one in my family. I probably got my sense of humor from his side. My dad and I fight, a lot. We never see eye to eye; we are constantly butting heads. Whenever we have something worth laughing over it seems to bring us a lot closer. I guess you could say that is about the only thing that we have in common. My dad's brother, who is my uncle, has a sense of humor like my dad's. However, I would like to think that my uncle and I are a lot closer than my dad and I are @CAPS2 seems to always be there for me @CAPS1 I need someone the most. @CAPS2 is all ears @CAPS1 it comes to my problems or just play-by-plays of my days. My uncle uses laughter as a cure. Whenever I am down or just upset, @CAPS2 is always there to make me feel better with a laugh or two.  Laughing really does bring everyone closer, in my family at least. My little sister and I have never really got along. Now that she is growing up, she is becoming more distant from me, and I miss being able to just talk to her about anything. Her and I have a weird sense of humor. We find the weirdest and dumbest things the funniest. We could just be watching television and the stupidest commercial would come on. All it takes is for one of us to find it somewhat hilarious and we both start laughing until we almost cry. I guess that's what holds us together. It's not the fighting, arguing, or even the good times; it's all of the laughs that we have shared with each other.  I have always thought that @CAPS1 you lose someone, either because they have disappeared from your life or because they have died, that you wouldn't be able to think of the times that you spent with each other. I am the kind of person who likes to keep everything inside me and not talk about it. I'm kind of a stubborn person. @CAPS1 I was younger my best friend was my grandma. Growing up, I was always over at her house. She taught me a lot about life; especially not to fear anything. She was always very spontaneous and wanting me to try new things. I remember one time, she put a flower in her mouth and sat outside. She told me to do it too, but all I did was look at her like she was crazy. As I watched her sit there, a hummingbird flew up and began sucking nectar from the flower, the flower that was in her mouth! After it flew off I grabbed a flower and sat next to her. @CAPS1 my family moved away, I didn't see her all that much. Ten years had gone by and my family recieved a call. My grandma was very sick. We went and saw her that weekend. Although my grandma was very ill, she still had that glow, and that same smile that always reminded me that it is okay to laugh and not be afraid. I saw her once more after that, the last time.  My grandma taught me about laughter. It is what made us so close. Laughter has been what has made my dad and I closer, and my sister and I still talk.

I am the kind of person who likes to keep everything inside me and not talk about it. I'm kind of a stubborn person. @CAPS1 I was younger my best friend was my grandma. Growing up, I was always over at her house. She taught me a lot about life; especially not to fear anything. She was always very spontaneous and wanting me to try new things. I remember one time, she put a flower in her mouth and sat outside. She told me to do it too, but all I did was look at her like she was crazy. As I watched her sit there, a hummingbird flew up and began sucking nectar from the flower, the flower that was in her mouth! After it flew off I grabbed a flower and sat next to her. @CAPS1 my family moved away, I didn't see her all that much. Ten years had gone by and my family recieved a call. My grandma was very sick. We went and saw her that weekend. Although my grandma was very ill, she still had that glow, and that same smile that always reminded me that it is okay to laugh and not be afraid. I saw her once more after that, the last time. My grandma taught me about laughter. It is what made us so close.

230,21935,8," Laughter in @CAPS1 A laugh is not just an action, it is also a meaning or connection. It is universal between countries and people for negative or positive reactions. I believe laughter breaks the tension in awkward positions, brightens a mood, or makes others smile when you laugh, but with the good comes the bad. People can feel outcast, betrayal, or embarrassed when they here laughter from different situations. An example of a negative outcome would be like giving a presentation to your boss for a promotion, when you get nervous you crack a joke to break the tension. Well it can end badly when the boss is to serious and doesn't laugh, then you start stuttering and lose confidence. Or another situation would be if you are a teacher or student passing a group of people in a crowded hallway, you hear your name and then lots of laughter, the assumption is that they are teasing you. Embarrassment is the result of this laughter. Laughter can hurt people if used in the wrong way. Laughter is also used for beneficial reasons. On a first date if he/she is nervous, trying a non-offensive joke might hit their giggle box and make the date a success. When someone is really mad the best way to steer clear of the storm is to make them laugh. Many bad situations can be turned into a good one by a smile, laugh, or a gesture of happiness. It is one of the things the whole human race shares. It unites friends, family, co-workers, bosses (sometimes), and just about everyone. Most people surround themselves with people who are good influences and make them happy. My boyfriend, when i first met him, didn't really smile or laugh at all. I, on the other hand have a very strong sense of humor so what i would laugh at he would look at me like i was crazy, he also looked confused. After three years I have finally come to understand why he was so confused. He didn't have a childhood. I mean that he was a child but he had to take care of himself ever since he was @NUM1 years-old. He only knew how to get satisfaction out of @CAPS1 by force and not by means of enjoyment so when he saw me laugh, he couldn't see how someone could be so happy. It makes my eyes water knowing the hardships he has had to go through but now when I look at him I see happiness and especially hope. He smiles and laughs a lot now. From him i learned a big lesson in @CAPS1 and for only being @NUM2, it is one of the most important so far. The lesson is that, no matter how bad your @CAPS1 is there will always be a better day. Laughter is the key to connections between anyone. It is what makes a day better, a person happier, and our world brighter. There will always be corrupt events happening no matter where you are but if you think about it hard enough you will see the up side to everything.

231,21937,8,"  LAUGHTER @CAPS1 i was younger my friend lived on a ranch and had many horses on it. Almost every weekend i would go over there to hang out with her. @CAPS1 we first started hanging out we were in @NUM1 grade and i never had really ridding a horse before. My first horse that i rode with her was a pony named pretty. She was large for a pony and i loved ridding her. She was especially trained for training beginner, which i was. After a year or so they moved to a different ranch, and the horse that i rode was a @CAPS2 bred named @PERSON2. She was a very gentle horse and i was more experienced with her.  One day @PERSON1 told me that she got rid of @PERSON2 and her and her sister both had got new horses, @ORGANIZATION1 was heathers, and @LOCATION1 was @PERSON1. Heathers horse was a @CAPS3 horse and they have more energy in them then the other horses i ever rode. @PERSON2 was a @CAPS4 and there just hot tempered. We all wanted to go on a trail ride and they didn't have an experienced enough horse for me to ride, besides @ORGANIZATION1, so heather rode this huge horse named cowboy, whose very calm, but is very stubborn @CAPS1 it comes to stopping. @PERSON1 rode her house @LOCATION1 and her mom rode her horse @CAPS5. So i was stuck with @ORGANIZATION1. She wasn't the best horse for beginners, but she was the best out of them all at the time. The first trail we went on was with all of and i had to be tide to @PERSON1 because @ORGANIZATION1 wasn't cooperating at the moment and we all went together. Then @PERSON1 decided that she wanted to go and run around in the pasture with all the other mares. I said i wouldn't mind because i trusted her. We ended up going the back way to the pasture and playing cops and robbers with the horses. It was intense. Once we got in the pasture @PERSON1 found a tarp on the ground and wanted to see if her horse would react. Well she did, @LOCATION1 kept trying to avoid it and stepping on it made loud noises, which had spooked my horse and she almost started rear, and took off towards the gate to leave. I had never been on a horse in full sprint going down a hill and i didn't know what to do, i was holding on with my legs, which seemed to only make her go faster. I started to slide off and i knew i was gonna fall so i just went for it. I had landed on my back and lost my breath. I looked to my side and had noticed all the other horses running towards me. They ended up going around and i was fine.  After that i was afraid to get on her again but @PERSON1 had help me see that if you fall down you need to get back up, also that if you fall of a horse you have to get back on so that they know that your not afraid and that they wont always get what they want.

232,21938,8," You know how the saying goes live, laugh, love. Laughter is an important part of any relationship you have, laughter is what brings you into people lives with the good times and good memories. Like me and my best friend for an example, i don't think we would be friends with-out all the laughter we bring into each others lives. Every time we are together we can just look at each other and start busting up laughing over nothing, or over previous memories we have had. Laughter is what has brought us closer and closer everyday, and has made our friendship stronger. I believe laughter is what starts any kind of good relationship or friendship.   Laughter is in everyday life i think that there are many good benefits of it, without laughter i think that we all would be lost. Its not just something you always just do when something was funny. Sometimes you can just sit there and laugh at the most stupid things, like something that was just so dumb that it was funny. It brings you and a person closer together because you and another person are laughing at the same things, so you are sharing an interest with the person. Pretty much you are finding out what you and the other person have in common, and finding out they think the same things are funny as you do. It shows that you are happy and that you are the type of person that know how to have fun.  Laughter is one of the most important things in life and in love. It is important in life because it gets you through the hard times sometimes, if someone can make you laugh then it can just makes your day a whole lot better. Its good to laugh because its healthy to be happy in life, and in the things that you do. Its also important in love to, when you laugh you show your partner that you are happy with them and that makes them happy to. If you never laugh they always assume that something is wrong, like your not happy, your sad, or depressed. Laughter is a very important emotion that we all have. It shows and it tell us a lot about the another persons and their personality and what they are like. I personally think that when people fall in love that one of the things they fall in love with is the persons laugh. It makes the other person happy when they know that they can make you laugh and that they can make you happy by doing so. Laughter is an amazing part of life the feeling of being happy and laughing just for that minute or however long it is makes memories you can never forget. With your closest friends you are always bringing up times you had together, reminding each other of what good times you had together laughing at something and couldn't stop. I think that everyone should laugh a little more and live a little more people don't do it often enough. If everyone would just laugh and be happy more i think that there would be way less bad things that people do if everyone just enjoyed life more often.Everyone should just make the best of what they have, and enjoy laughing and spending time with the people closest to you more. After all laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. With all these benefits of laughter it really does help you out in life.
