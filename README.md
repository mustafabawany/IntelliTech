# IntelliTech

## Problem Statement

Human tutoring seems effective at improving students’ performance, but it is time-consuming and labor-intensive.IntelliTech aims to establish good grounds to minimize human efforts in score reporting and provide a hallmark solution to digitalize and automate the test
administration process, score reporting, and feedback provision to benefit large-scale and formative assessments.
<br>
<br>
Moreover, IntelliTech aims to eliminate the factors like human bias which includes rater fatigue, rater’s expertise, severity/leniency, scale shrinkage, stereotyping, rater drift, perception difference, and inconsistency.
<br>
<br>
Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) may suffer from its own biases which may include imperfections in training data, and fake correlations so it is our core objective to make AES more fair, transparent, accountable, and unbiased while remaining accurate to be used in large-scale assessments and classroom settings.
The end objective would constitute developing an intuitive web application to assist teachers and students to create forms for
assessments and upload answer scripts to get evaluated.

## Description

IntelliTech is a web-based application that enables teachers to create forms consisting of open-ended questions and MCQs for students to fill, and automatically evaluates and scores their responses using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques. The evaluation of essays is a challenging task for simple programming techniques due to the varying explanations provided by students. Thus, we propose an Automated Essay Scoring (AES) framework that uses Deep Learning models like LSTM, Bi-LSTM to evaluate the student's response based on set rubrics. The proposed framework aims to provide a flexible and efficient way to automate test administration and score reporting, support students' learning, and enhance the education system's shift to online modes.
